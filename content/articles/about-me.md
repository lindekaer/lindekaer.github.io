## Experience
My first job in the industry was at **IBM**. I conducted data analysis for the sales department and monitored KPIs. I returned to IBM in a similar position after my semester abroad in S√£o Paulo, Brazil üáßüá∑

I gradually realized that I loved programming. By coincidence I saw a job poster for a student frontend developer position in a web development company called **Dwarf**. This marked the beginning of a rigorous, tough and amazingly rewarding time of getting up to speed with web technology alongside my business studies. I got the position and helped create website for some of the major Danish brands üöÄ

After more than a year of web development I was headhunted the logistics technology startup **Shipbeat**. I decided to join them as Customer Success Manager - a positon spanning from writing technical documentation, helping customers and doing frontend development both internal and external tools. Unfortunately Shipbeat went bankrupt in the summer of 2016.

Most recently I have started my own consulting company offering programming services ‚ö°Ô∏è. This has led to employment in the startup **WakieWakie**. I am the lead backend developer building the infrastructure from scratch in Node. In addition to writing Node, I manage several AWS services such as DynamoDB and Lambda.
