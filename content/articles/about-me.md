## Technologies
My technological competencies revolve around web systems. I have started as a frontend developer doing HTML, CSS and client side JS, but have progressed to also doing backend development. My language of choice for backend development is Node. I consider myself a fullstack developer.

- **Task runners** - Gulp, Webpack
- **Testing** - Mocha, Chai, Supertest
- **Databases** - MySQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB
- **AWS** - Lambda, S3, CloudFront
- **CI and deployment** - Heroku, CircleCI, Docker
- **Misc.** - Pug, Babel, Sass, PostCSS, Redis, Claudia, Serverless

## Experience
My first job in the industry was at **IBM**. I conducted data analysis for the sales department and monitored KPIs. I returned to IBM in a similar position after my semester abroad in S√£o Paulo, Brazil üáßüá∑

I gradually realized that I loved programming. By coincidence I saw a job poster for a student frontend developer position in a web development company called **Dwarf**. This marked the beginning of a rigorous, tough and amazingly rewarding time of getting up to speed with web technology alongside my business studies. I got the position and helped create website for some of the major Danish brands üöÄ

After more than a year of web development I was headhunted by the logistics technology startup **Shipbeat**. I decided to join them as Customer Success Manager - a positon spanning from writing technical documentation and helping customers to doing frontend development for both internal and external tools. Unfortunately Shipbeat went bankrupt in the summer of 2016.

Most recently I have started my own consulting company offering programming services ‚ö°Ô∏è. This has led to employment in the startup **WakieWakie**. I am the lead backend developer building the infrastructure from scratch in Node. In addition to writing Node, I manage several AWS services such as DynamoDB and Lambda.

## Projects
Meanwhile working as a frontend developer I started a small side project called **Meal Planner** with my friend Bertram. We developed software to automatically generate personalized diets for athletes üçáüçâüçå. We spun the project into a company and had a $20,000 profit in our first year of operation. I used a PHP backend with a Node PDF-rendering microservice to provide our services.

I love to travel and especially sharing the amazing moments I experience. Prior to walking the [Camino de Santiago](http://lindekaer.com/camino-de-santiago.html) I started tinkering with a GSM modem and a SIM-card to make it possible for me to send SMS with geolocation back home while traveling. This date should then be displayed on a web based map for all my friends and family to follow. This led to me developing **Hikebeat** with my friends Niklas, Jesper and Dimitar. Today Hikebeat is available as an IOS app - check it out at [Hikebeat.io](https://hikebeat.io).
