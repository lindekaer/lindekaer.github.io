In the summer of 2015 I started out on an amazing journey with my friend Andrei. We decided to dedicate one month to walking the Camino de Santiago. It turned out that the decision to go would have lasting impact on our life.

## History
Since the Middle Ages pilgrims have been walking towards Santiago as it is believed that the remains of St. James are buried there; hence the English name St. James's Way. The symbol for the Camino is a scallop shell - in the Middle Ages, bringing back a scallop shell was the proof for having visited the Atlantic Coast. The scallop shell also holds great symbolic power, as the grooves in the shell meet at the same point and thereby symbolizes the joint goal of reaching the shrine in Santiago.

## The pilgrimage
We decided to walk Camino Francés (there are [many different caminos](http://www.caminoguides.com/route.html)), which starts in the small French town **St. Jean Pied de Port** and ends in **Santiago de Compostela**. The total route amounts to roughly 800 kilometers. We also planned to walk an additional 90 kilometers to the city of **Fisterra**, which plays a central role in the pilgrimage. In pre-Christian times Fisterra was regarded as the *end of the world*.

When starting out in St. Jean Pied de Port we recieved a hiking guide all the way to Santiago. It was suggested to walk an average of 23 kilometers per day and thus reach Santiago in 35 days. The number of kilometers that one is able to walk every day highly depends on the terrain and the weather. We experienced extremes in both ends - walking in 45° from Pamplona and traversing the steep Pyrenees. It was a great comfort to have the guide at hand for looking ahead while walking, but we didn't strictly follow it. We ended up walking a bit ahead and completed the camino in just 28 days.
