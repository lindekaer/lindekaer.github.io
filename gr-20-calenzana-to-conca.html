These predicates could nothing but intrigue me and I therefore decided to give the hike a go in late June. The hike is found on the French island of Corsica.</p><p>In case you wonder what <em>GR</em> means, I&apos;ve written a detailed description of my first <a href="/gr-6-barcelona-to-montserrat.html"><em>GR hike</em> in Spain</a>.</p><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>The GR 20 goes between the cities of Calenzana and Conca on Corsica. It is possible go both north and south bound. The trail is about 180 kilometers and goes through very varied terrain. For this reason, the hike is categorized as <em>advanced</em>. Commonly the hike is divided into the northern and sourthern part with the first going from Calenzana to Vizzavona and the latter from Vizzavona to Conca.</p><div id="map1" data-lat="42.1661991" data-lng="9.1350079" data-zoom="8" data-type="outdoors"><div data-lat="42.507540" data-lng="8.855557" data-label="Calenzana"></div><div data-lat="42.128045" data-lng="9.133520" data-label="Vizzavona"></div><div data-lat="41.734041" data-lng="9.334552" data-label="Conca"></div></div><h2 id="my-hike">My hike</h2><p>I decided to allocate 10 days for the actual hike. The hike consists of 15 stages and it is commonly recommended to do one stage a day. However, due to other holiday plans I was short on time. To my delight, I found that many people have completed the GR 20 in much less than 15 days. Of particular inspiration for my planning was <a href="http://c8h10n4o2.org/walking/gr20/">Pete&apos;s blog</a>. I settled on walking south bound and doing double stages every day.</p><p>A quick note - <em>refuge</em> is the French word for a small hostel. Typically a small mountain hut with beds, camping grounds and the possibility to buy food.</p><h3 id="first-day-calenzana-to-refuge-d-ortu-di-u-piobbu-stage-1-">First day - Calenzana to Refuge d&apos;Ortu di u Piobbu (stage 1)</h3><p>I arrived to Calvi around 10:00 and grabbed a taxi straight to Calenzana (the price was approx. EUR 40). I went to the local supermarket and bought a lunch consisting of pizza and yoghourt - I also bought hiking snacks for the first days. After having eaten I started the hike; the trail can be reached by walking to the left of bar &quot;Le GR 20&quot;.</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.calenzana-square.jpg" title="The small square of Calenzana.

Fill your water here in the fountain</p></div><p>The ascent started from the first step and the heat was fierce. I quickly learned to pay attention to the GR signs, as I missed one and walked 20 minutes in the wrong direction - whoops!</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.small-sign.jpg" title="Pay attention to the small signs" alt="Pay attention to the small signs"><p class="media__caption">Pay attention to the small signs</p></div><p>When climbing the mountains the backwards view of Calvi was nothing but stunning. Towards the end of the stage I spotted the refuge on the other side of the valley. As I also learned that day, being able to see your destination does not mean that you are close.</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.calvi-view.jpg" title="Amazing view of the Calvi bay area" alt="Amazing view of the Calvi bay area"><p class="media__caption">Amazing view of the Calvi bay area</p></div><p>At the refuge I paid for a camp site (EUR 7) and ordered the full dinner menu (EUR 20). I had to be creative when setting up my tent as the ground was very rocky - as my Swiss companion, Marcel, showed me, bringing extra rope for tying your tent to rocks is a must.</p><h3 id="second-day-refuge-d-ortu-di-u-piobbu-to-haut-asco-stage-2-and-3-">Second day - Refuge d&apos;Ortu di u Piobbu to Haut Asco (stage 2 and 3)</h3><p>I woke up at around 4:30 unable to sleep anymore. I was simply too excited. This day was of great importance, since it was my first encountering with doing a double stage. Additionally, the first stages in the north are known to be the toughest. I was in for a treat.</p><p>After eating a few small yoghourts I packed my stuff and got on the move. Finding it really hard to navigate in the thick forest, I was relieved to spot a bright red backpack up the trail. It turned out to belong to an old, hardcore, French hiker called Germain. Despite him not speaking English and my French being rusty, we ended up hiking for almost all of stage 2 together.</p><p>After some awesome rocky mountain traversal I reached Bocca Innuminata and took a small rest. From here on Carrozzu was only a one hour descent away.</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.bocca-innuminata.jpg" title="Well deserved rest at Bocca Innuminata" alt="Well deserved rest at Bocca Innuminata"><p class="media__caption">Well deserved rest at Bocca Innuminata</p></div><p>In Carrozzu I had a quick lunch and an electrolyte drink. I made the mistake of leaving for Haut Asco too early and thereby climbing in the worst midday heat. Lesson learned! Right after Carrozzu you find a suspension bridge crossing a small river with small waterfalls. <em>Stop here to take a swim and enjoy life</em>, plenty of strain coming up ahead.</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.suspension-bridge.jpg" title="The awesome suspension bridge" alt="The awesome suspension bridge"><p class="media__caption">The awesome suspension bridge</p></div><p>Climbing up alongside the river is challenging as the slabs of rock lack texture. There are a few sections with chains for security. Once reaching the top you find a small valley with a peaceful mountain lake - did I say swim again?</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.rocky-slabs.jpg" title="There is only one way - up!" alt="There is only one way - up!"><p class="media__caption">There is only one way - up!</p></div><p>After a little climb you reach the most amazing viewpoint. I was blown away! After a snack I started the grueling two hour descent to Haut Asco. To compensate for the struggles, you find a restaurant (that accepts credit card) in Haut Asco. I ordered the full menu and fell asleep as soon as I hit my mat.</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.haut-asco-tent.jpg" title="My rather sloppy tent setup at Haut Asco" alt="My rather sloppy tent setup at Haut Asco"><p class="media__caption">My rather sloppy tent setup at Haut Asco</p></div><h3 id="third-day-haut-asco-to-refuge-de-ciottulu-di-i-mori-stage-4-and-5-">Third day - Haut Asco to Refuge de Ciottulu di i Mori (stage 4 and 5)</h3><p>Waking up I immediately felt the hard work from yesterday&apos;s hike. I turned off the alarm and snoozed until 06:00. Quickly packing my stuff, I left shortly after. The first climb of the day was for Monte Cinto, which also is the highest point on all of Corsica. The trail started out in a nice pine forest, but as I gained altitude the trees were replaced by big slabs of rock. Occasionally chains were encountered during the climb.</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.going-up.jpg" title="The beautiful view from Haut Asco towards Monte Cinto" alt="The beautiful view from Haut Asco towards Monte Cinto"><p class="media__caption">The beautiful view from Haut Asco towards Monte Cinto</p></div><p>I went fast and passed a few groups. About one hour before reaching the top plateau, I encountered a bit of snow. I could imagine the traversal being much more difficult earlier in the year.</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.snow.jpg" title="Yes, just a bit of snow" alt="Yes, just a bit of snow"><p class="media__caption">Yes, just a bit of snow</p></div><p>From the plateau it was possible to climb to the peak of Monte Cinto. Doing so required approximately two hours going back and forth. I skipped it and pushed on for the end of the stage at Refuge de Tighjettu. Reaching the hut I was smashed. The descent was tough and I severely lacked some hiking poles. I decided to call it a day, but after having had a huge lunch I felt energized and decided to head for Refuge de Ciottulu di i Mori.</p><p>Half of the stage went on a mostly flat forest path, but suddenly it turned almost vertical. It was a steep climb and not the best way to finish off the day. Taking a few small breaks during the climb I managed to get to the top. From here I could see the refuge. Only 30 minutes later I was asleep with my belly full of spaghetti.</p><div class="media group"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.spaghetti.jpg" title="Simple but good meal" alt="Simple but good meal"> <img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.tent-chill.jpg" title="Chilling in the tent at Refuge de Ciottulu di i Mori" alt="Chilling in the tent at Refuge de Ciottulu di i Mori"><p class="media__caption">A simple meal and a bit of relaxation</p></div><h3 id="fourth-day-refuge-de-ciottulu-di-i-mori-to-refuge-de-manganu-stage-6-and-7-">Fourth day - Refuge de Ciottulu di i Mori to Refuge de Manganu (stage 6 and 7)</h3><p>Waking up I felt good. I had completed two days of double stages in the northern part. Confident in knowing I would get to Conca, I packed my stuff and boiled spaghetti to bring for lunch. I did not carry any guidebook or map, so my day to day planning relied on talking to other hikers. Two guys (coming from the south) told me that the next stage was very short and easy and the next quite a lot longer. With this in mind I started out.</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.easy-day.jpg" title="Nice and flat terrain from the morning" alt="Nice and flat terrain from the morning"><p class="media__caption">Nice and flat terrain from the morning</p></div><p>After three hours of hiking I expected to see the refuge just around every corner - it just never was. On my sixth hour I got to know that a hotel named Castellu di Verghio, that I had passed earlier in the morning, actually was considered the end of a stage. Without knowing I had begun yet another double stage hike heading for Refuge de Manganu.</p><p>I passed the beautiful Lac de Nino lake and thought to myself that Refuge de Manganu had to be close. However, still two hours of hiking in fairly flat terrain remained. I would later be told that the double stage (commonly walked together and therefore considered as one) has a length of 23 kilometers - the longest on the GR 20.</p><p>I stopped for a little while at a local bergerie (small family-owned shop) to have a drink. To my luck I meet two wonderful Norwegian women, Wenche and Tori, who were planning to hike two additional stages past Manganu the next couple of days.</p><p>Arriving at Refuge de Manganu shortly after I met Wenche and Tori again. I was running short on cash and with no ATMs on the whole route, I was planning to cut it short and stop in Vizzavona. Fortunately they were kind enough to lend me EUR 70 and even invited me to their table for dinner. I am very thankful for their support and care!</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.love-and-support.jpg" title="Wenche and Tori at Refuge de Manganu" alt="Wenche and Tori at Refuge de Manganu"><p class="media__caption">Wenche and Tori at Refuge de Manganu</p></div><h3 id="fifth-day-refuge-de-manganu-to-refuge-de-l-onda-stage-8-and-9-">Fifth day - Refuge de Manganu to Refuge de l&apos;Onda (stage 8 and 9)</h3><p>When I woke up I was thrilled. Thanks to Wenche and Tori I was back in the game and heading for Conca. I started out at 06:00 and began the climb. I planned on reaching Refuge de Pietra Piana for lunch and subsequently head for Refuge de l&apos;Onda. The hike was diverse and changed from rock climbing to casual walking in green valleys between the peaks. I arrived to Pietra Piana within only five hours and went straight to the small shop to buy a can of cassoulet (French stew with beans, sausage and meats). Lovely lunch with the most spectacular view.</p><div class="media group"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.cassoulet.jpg" title="Simple but good meal" alt="Simple but good meal"> <img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.pietra-piana.jpg" title="Refuge de Pietra Piana" alt="Refuge de Pietra Piana"><p class="media__caption">Cassoulet by the Pietra Piana hut</p></div><p>From Pietra Piana one has the choice between a high and a low pass both leading to Refuge de l&apos;Onda. The low pass descends to a green valley and ends with a small climb, while the high pass maintains the altitude and follows the mountain range. I opted for the latter. The high pass was very rough but stunningly beautiful and I enjoyed every step except for a the last 40 minutes of descending. Arriving to the refuge I could hardly believe my own eyes - a lawn! Finally I had the opportunity to set up my tent with all pegs. I cooked a huge portion of pasta and went to bed early.</p><div class="media group"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.mountain-of-pasta.jpg" title="A mountain of pasta" alt="A mountain of pasta"> <img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.tent-on-lawn.jpg" title="The tent on the lawn" alt="The tent on the lawn"><p class="media__caption">Perfect place to camp</p></div><h3 id="sixth-day-refuge-de-l-onda-to-bergeries-de-capannelle-stage-10-and-11-">Sixth day - Refuge de l&apos;Onda to Bergeries de Capannelle (stage 10 and 11)</h3><p>I decided to sleep in and planned to leave at 07:00. The day before, I had briefly talked with another hiker, Nikolas, who also stopped for the night in Refuge de l&apos;Onda. He invited me for breakfast and we hiked together towards Vizzavona.</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.nikolas.jpg" title="Nikolas and I heading towards Vizzavona" alt="Nikolas and I heading towards Vizzavona"><p class="media__caption">Nikolas and I heading towards Vizzavona</p></div><p>It stage started out with a steep ascent towards Bocca du Porco. From the top, there was only one way - down. The descent starts out steep and rocky but quickly turns into an easier forest path. About two and a half hours later, we arrived to Vizzavona. I had personally been looking forward to this stop, as it marked the end of the northern section of GR 20 (and you could buy pizzas and beer ... by credit card!).</p><p>It was sad to say goodbye to Nikolas, who had to take the train from Vizzavona, as he was heading home to Paris. I pushed on to complete yet another stage ending at Bergeries de Capannelle. The hike felt extremely long, but I think this was due to me walking in the late afternoon and having had a humongous lunch.</p><p>Eventually I made it. Bergeries de Capannelle is a ski resort during winter times. I met some great people in the cabin - we watched football at night and had some well deserved beers.</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.chilling.jpg" title="Having a beer for the Beligum vs. Wales football match" alt="Having a beer for the Beligum vs. Wales football match"><p class="media__caption">Having a beer for the Beligum vs. Wales football match</p></div><h3 id="seventh-day-bergeries-de-capannelle-to-refuge-d-usciolu-stage-12-and-13-">Seventh day - Bergeries de Capannelle to Refuge d&apos;Usciolu (stage 12 and 13)</h3><p>Waking up in the morning I could feel a severe ache in my Achielle&apos;s tendon. It had been bugging me for a few days, but this morning it had also gotten pretty stiff. I limped to the bergerie and evaluated the situation. I had only two days left to complete the full hike, but on the other hand I didn&apos;t want to run the risk of a serious injury. Having made up my mind I went to the terrace and watched the sunrise feeling in peace with stopping for now.</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.sunrise.jpg" title="My last sunrise on the GR 20 - for now!" alt="My last sunrise on the GR 20 - for now!"><p class="media__caption">My last sunrise on the GR 20 - for now!</p></div><p>I left Bergeries de Capannelle by the mountain road - it was only a three hour walk to the main road. I decided to hitchhike my way north, which turned out to be a good decision. Within 30 minutes is was in a car with a lovely Swiss couple who drove me all the way to Corte. From there I had easy access to Calvi by train.</p><h2 id="back-to-civilization">Back to civilization</h2><p>Ending my hike a few days earlier freed up some extra time for the beach. I decided to spend my time in the city of Calvi on the northern coast of Corsica, since this was also where I was flying home from. Calvi turned out to provide exactly what I needed - a much needed excuse for lying on the beach and eating vast amounts of food.</p><div class="media group"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.calvi-beach.jpg" title="Relaxation on the beach" alt="Relaxation on the beach"> <img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.ferry.jpg" title="The ferry going to mainland France" alt="The ferry going to mainland France"> <img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.supermarket.jpg" title="Back in the supermarket" alt="Back in the supermarket"> <img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.calvi-citadel.jpg" title="The view of Calvi from the old citadel" alt="The view of Calvi from the old citadel"><p class="media__caption">Back in the comforts of civilization</p></div><p>I ended up staying at a camp site close to the beach paying only EUR 14 per night. As a counter balance to my sudden inactivity I headed for a small trip to the church Notre Dame de la Serra, which is located in the hills behind Calvi. What a magnificent view!</p><div class="media wide"><img class="media__image" data-src="gr-20-calenzana-to-conca.calvi-panorama.jpg" title="Beautiful panorama from Notre Dame de la Serra" alt="Beautiful panorama from Notre Dame de la Serra"><p class="media__caption">Beautiful panorama from Notre Dame de la Serra</p></div><p>I also spent one day as a tourist exploring the old town. The citadel of Calvi is worth a visit - I particularly enjoyed visiting the base for the parachute division of the French Legion.</p><h2 id="the-experience-as-a-whole">The experience as a whole</h2><p>I loved the GR 20. I have never walked a trail that rough, beautiful and challenging. When I return, I will do only single stages and spend more time enjoying the superb views, swim in the lakes and rest a bit more. I felt a positive vibe along the whole trail and I only met friendly people. The hike has my greatest recommendations!</p></main></article><div class="navigation__back"><a href="/">Go to main page</a></div><script src="frontend/dist/scripts/dist-vendor.min.js"></script><script src="frontend/dist/scripts/dist.min.js"></script></body></html>
