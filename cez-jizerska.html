This led me and my friends Karel, Andrei and Patrik to sign up for the Czech race <strong>&#x10C;ez Jizersk&#xE1; 50</strong>. It turned out that <strong>50</strong> was not only an indication of the number of kilometers to ski, but also a celebration of the event&apos;s 50th anniversary. I call it timing!</p><h2 id="godlike-accommodation">Godlike accommodation</h2><p>The race took place in and around the area of Bedrichov. Fortunately Karel had a good friend in the nearby city of Liberec. In fact, Karel&apos;s friend is a priest at the local monestary and he invited us to crash there. We could not have wished for more generous accommodation.</p><div id="map1" data-lat="50.791088" data-lng="15.142471" data-zoom="9" data-type="streets"><div data-lat="50.791088" data-lng="15.142471" data-label="Bedrichov"></div></div><h2 id="unexpected-help">Unexpected help</h2><p>We did a small 20 km run on the day prior to the race to test the area. As I was heading up a hill, I slowly passed a guy. Trying to impress I attempted to increase my speed, but as I hadn&apos;t had time to wax my skis, this only led me to losing grip. They guy turned in the track and asked me about my skis - first encounter with Thomas. We caught up with the other guys a few kilometers later and grabbed a cup of sweet tea. As Thomas saw Andrei&apos;s classic touring skis he was shocked - <em>&quot;you can&apos;t complete Jizersk&#xE1; on those!&quot;</em>.</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="cez-jizerska.thomas.jpg" title="Meeting Thomas (in the middle) by a small bar in the woods" alt="Meeting Thomas (in the middle) by a small bar in the woods"><p class="media__caption">Meeting Thomas (in the middle) by a small bar in the woods</p></div><p>After talking back and forth Thomas offered Andrei to let him borrow his skis - talk about being lucky! Andrei gladly accepted and invited Thomas to join us for dinner the same day. Thomas and his wife later invited us for dinner at their home at the day of the race - we are so thankful for their hospitality and kindness.</p><h2 id="race-results">Race results</h2><p>50 km classic cross country skiing with 937 m elevation gain</p><ul><li><strong>03:04:16</strong> - Patrik Andersson &#x1F3C6;</li><li><strong>04:34:45</strong> - Karel Navr&#xE1;til</li><li><strong>04:56:39</strong> - Theodor Lindekaer</li><li><strong>06:06:12</strong> - Andrei Ursachi</li></ul><p>Patrik did a fantastic job and finished only a few minutes from the 3 hour bracket - great performance considering no track preparation prior to the race. Karel is a fighter and pushed hard throughout the whole race. Despite cramps and considering the fact that he normally only practices <em>ski skating</em> he finished better than expected. However, the greatest fighter of them all was Andrei, who completed the race with close to zero skiing experience. I am still mindblown by his achievement! &#x1F44A;</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="cez-jizerska.group.jpg" title="Eager to get started - pumped and excited!" alt="Eager to get started - pumped and excited!"><p class="media__caption">Eager to get started - pumped and excited!</p></div><h2 id="having-fun">Having fun</h2><p>Being with the guys is always a blast and we really managed to squeeze out a lot of great experiences in short time.
