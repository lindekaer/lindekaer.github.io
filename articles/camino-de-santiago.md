In the summer of 2015 I started out on an amazing journey with my friend Andrei. We decided to dedicate one month to walking the Camino de Santiago. Before we knew it, we had met many wonderful people that would turn out to become some of our closest friends.

## History
Since the Middle Ages pilgrims have been walking towards Santiago as it is believed that the remains of St. James are buried there; hence the English name St. James's Way. The symbol for the Camino is a scallop shell - in the Middle Ages, bringing back a scallop shell was the proof for having visited the Atlantic Coast. The scallop shell also holds great symbolic power, as the grooves in the shell meet at the same point and thereby symbolizes the joint goal of reaching the shrine in Santiago.

The camino is gaining a lot of popularity in recent times. Today more than 200,000 start the pilgrimage towards Santiago, while only few attempted the same in the 1980s. Since 1987 the Camino de Santiago has been present on UNESCO's list of [world heritages sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site).

## The pilgrimage
We decided to walk Camino Francés (there are [many different caminos](http://www.caminoguides.com/route.html)), which starts in the small French town **St. Jean Pied de Port** and ends in **Santiago de Compostela**. The total route amounts to roughly 800 kilometers. We also planned to walk an additional 90 kilometers to the city of **Fisterra**, which plays a central role in the pilgrimage. In pre-Christian times Fisterra was regarded as the *end of the world* due to its western location and proximity to the endless Atlantic ocean.

When starting out in St. Jean Pied de Port we received a hiking guide suggesting daily hikes all the way to Santiago. It was suggested to walk an average of 23 kilometers per day and thus reach Santiago in 35 days. The number of kilometers that one is able to walk every day highly depends on the terrain and the weather. We experienced extremes in both ends - walking in 45 ℃ from Pamplona and traversing the steep Pyrenees. It was a great comfort to have the guide at hand for looking ahead while walking, but we didn't strictly follow it. We ended up walking a bit ahead and completed the camino in just 28 days.

## Accommodation
Throughout the pilgrimage you find plenty of opportunities for accommodation. In most cities, you find public hostels that are publicly owned and often a bit cheaper than the private alternatives. Additionally many churches and monasteries along the way open their doors to pilgrims. We found these experiences to be the most memorable and provide the most authentic experiences. The prices range from EUR 5-15 per night (often including a simple meal).

Staying for the night is a wonderful opportunity to get to know the other pilgrims. It was not unusual to sleep 20 people in the same room and engaging in conversations was therefore inevitable. If you desire more comfort, many hostels offer both private and double rooms. Despite it being hard to pick, here are some suggestions for hostels worth a visit:

- Hostel 1 
- Hostel 2
- Hostel 3

## People
In the Camino people are everything. The camino is a special journey; the daily grind is left at home, the phone barely has signal and every day passes by in a gentle pace of memorable moments. On top of this, you stay active for the entire day and spend every moment in nature. This, I believe, brings forth the best in people.

The motivations for walking the camino are as manyfold as the number of places on your feet where you can have blisters. Some people have faced a life-changing event at home and seek the contemplation of the open road, while others seek out the physical challenge of walking nonstop for one month. Personally, I saw the camino as an opportunity to do something completely different and spend some quality time with Andrei.
