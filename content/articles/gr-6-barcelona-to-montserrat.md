Europe is a treasure trove when it comes to hiking. One of the pearls to be found is the hike from Barcelona to Montserrat, which is part of the footpath family called [Grande Randonnée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GR_footpath) (commonly abbreviated as GR). The aforementioned hike is number six in Spain and does thus go under the name of **GR 6**. I went for the two-day hike in May.

## Barcelona
My dear friend Connor, whom I met when studying in São Paulo, is currently working in Barcelona and was kind enough to let me and my three travel companions sleep at his place. He and his girlfriend Kellie took us to the small streets in the Barri Gotic area. Loading up on tapas and wine we slowly prepared for our departure next morning.

## The trail
The GR 6 is only 55 kilometers which makes it perfect for a weekend hike. The trail starts at the outskirts of Barcelona, right behind a campus area for the University of Barcelona. It starts off with a bit of a climb, which quickly takes you to an amazing viewpoint. We were immediately impressed by the condition of the trail - great dusty and rocky path, but still well maintained and easy to follow. This feeling did not cease at any point during the whole hike.

We generally kept a good pace and had few breaks. Here is picture from our lunch break approximately 15 kilometers from Barcelona. A *Clara* is a mixture of beer and lemonade - really refreshing and well deserved!

## A night in Ullastrell
On our first day of hiking we rounded 40 kilometers before calling it a day. Approaching the small city Ullastrell, we decided to head there in search of accommodation. We were quickly greeted by a friendly local guy, who gave us directions for the local hostel. As we headed for the hostel, we encountered even more locals who all pointed us towards the small town square. On the square, we met the same guy, who initially helped us out. It turned out that he was the vice mayor of the city!

Before we knew it, he had opened the door to the town hall and guided us to the small dormitory on the backside. The hostel had just opened few weeks prior to our arrival. Ullastrell turned out to me an amazing local experience. The hostel was great, the local bar was vibrant and packed, and the small supermarket offered everything we desired.

## Montserrat
Montserrat is an impressive mountain that pops from the surrounding landscape, with the highest summit reaching 1236 meters.
The name Montserrat means *saw mountain*, which very well describes the serrated look of the mountain. Because of the steep cliff sides Montserrat is a popular destination for climbers and hikers. Before we started our ascend, we had a lunch break in Collbató by the foot of the mountain. The city was idyllic and turned out to be a perfect oasis to relax before our struggles.

The trail leading up Montserrat to the Santa Maria de Montserrat monastery was **awesome**. It was steep, rocky, varied and sprinkled with the most amazing views of the surrounding area. Most amazing of it all was the view of the monastery from above.

Having slept at the monastery (for only EUR 6), we got up early and headed for a mountain summit sunrise. Hiking up the mountain in the tranquility of the morning was stunning!

## Experience in a nutshell
I am always amazed by how much you can experience in just a few days of hiking. However, this trip has raised the bar even further. The GR 6 has my strongest recommendations. The hike is not difficult and can be completed by anyone having three full days available. I will continue to explore the GR routes!
