However, on my most recent travel I had my eyes opened. Romania has an exciting cuisine, beautiful nature, abundance of historical sites and amazingly friendly people. I went for one week with a group of friends in the beginning of May.</p><h2 id="travel-plan">Travel plan</h2><p>Doing Romania in one week is impossible. At first we settled for a plan including many hours of driving every day, but eventually decide to stay in Bra&#x219;ov take day trips from there. We found a great hostel at a cost of only 10 EUR per night including breakfast. My friend Andrei, who is Romanian, had done a great job of planning our days and was an amazing driver for the whole week.</p><div id="map1" data-lat="45.6288228" data-lng="25.8483354" data-zoom="7" data-type="streets"><div data-lat="45.657975" data-lng="25.601198" data-label="Bra&#x219;ov"></div><div data-lat="46.219702" data-lng="24.796388" data-label="Sigi&#x219;hoara"></div><div data-lat="44.426767" data-lng="26.102538" data-label="Bucharest"></div><div data-lat="45.409715" data-lng="25.534224" data-label="Busteni"></div><div data-lat="46.567044" data-lng="26.914575" data-label="Bac&#x103;u"></div></div><h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2><h3 id="bran-castle">Bran Castle</h3><p>As the name of this post states Dracula was of great importance for our trip. In the hunt for Dracula, we went to the castle of Bran, which to many is closely tied to the Dracula. Popularly, the Wallachian ruler Vlad &#x21A;epe&#x219; (known as Vlad the Impaler due to brutal impalings of enemies of war) is associated with the the Dracula as he took the name <strong>Dracul</strong> as part of his role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Dragon">The Order of the Dragon</a>. However, Vlad is only known to have stayed at Bran Castle for short durations.</p><p>Despite Vlad&apos;s remote connection to Bran, the castle hosts a great museum with interesting facts about the tale of the Dracula. I learned that the Irish author Bram Stoker played a big part in popularizing the tale of the Dracula through his release of his book <em>&quot;Dracula&quot;</em> in 1897.</p><div class="media group"><img class="media__image" data-src="hunting-for-dracula.market.jpg" title="Market in front of Bran Castle" alt="Market in front of Bran Castle"> <img class="media__image" data-src="hunting-for-dracula.andrei-and-vlad.jpg" title="Andrei and Vlad" alt="Andrei and Vlad"> <img class="media__image" data-src="hunting-for-dracula.outside-the-castle.jpg" title="The family outside the Bran Castle" alt="The family outside the Bran Castle"> <img class="media__image" data-src="hunting-for-dracula.shields.jpg" title="Coat of arms on the walls of Bran Castle" alt="Coat of arms on the walls of Bran Castle"><p class="media__caption">Visiting the Bran Castle and the nearby market</p></div><h3 id="libearty-bear-sanctuary">Libearty Bear Sanctuary</h3><p>Around 50% of the European bears live in Romania and have therefore been hunted and captivated for centuries. To this day, some bears are still kept in captivity and displayed, often under harsh conditions, as a tourist attraction. The opening of the bear sanctuary outside of Bra&#x219;ov was a reaction to this maltreatment and seeks to bring the bears into their natural habitat.</p><p>Visiting the bear sanctuary you get to see plenty of bears and are told their stories. Part of the entrance fee goes as a direct donation to the backing foundation.</p><h3 id="sigi-hoara">Sigi&#x219;hoara</h3><p>The city of Sigi&#x219;hoara is on the UNESCO list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site">World Heritage Sites</a>. The old city center behind the city walls boasts of well-preserved medieval buildings. In particular, we enjoyed visiting <em>Biserica din Deal</em> church on top of the hill. Also, the main gate (previously the town hall) acted as a good viewpoint and contained a small museum. Sigi&#x219;hoara is perfect for one day of historical indulgence!</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="hunting-for-dracula.sigishoara.jpg" title="View from the main gate of Sigi&#x219;hoara" alt="View from the main gate of Sigi&#x219;hoara"><p class="media__caption">View from the main gate of Sigi&#x219;hoara</p></div><h3 id="parc-aventura-bra-ov">Parc Aventura Bra&#x219;ov</h3><p>In the adventure park we tried tree top walking. Wearing a safety harness (and attached to security lines) we moved from tree to tree by passing obstacles - these obstacles went from slacklining to rope climbing. It was <strong>so much fun</strong> and really got the adrenalin rushing. The park offered many different courses of varying difficulty, so there was something for everyone.</p><p>I was very close to completing the black course, but suddenly a thunder storm with fierce rain was above us. We were told to stay at the platform and had to rappel down from the tree. Wow, that was quite an experience! Check out their website <a href="http://www.parc-aventura.ro/">here</a>.</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="hunting-for-dracula.tree-top.jpg" title="Klara getting ready to transition from one obstacle to another" alt="Klara getting ready to transition from one obstacle to another"><p class="media__caption">Klara getting ready to transition from one obstacle to another</p></div><h3 id="pele-castle">Pele&#x219; Castle</h3><p>Visiting the Pele&#x219; Castle was amazing. The castle was richly adorned both on the in and outside. It was built between 1873 and 1914 and was intended to serve as a royal summer residence. The name of the castle is derived from the small Pele&#x219; river that runs nearby.</p><p>The castle&apos;s location is close to perfect - located in the middle of a spectacular mountain scenery with thick forests. The castle itself is placed in a glade in the midst of this. We visited the castle in heavy rain, but were not less impressed with the whole setting. We decided to go for the guided tour (highly recommended), which takes you through a small selection of the lushly decorated rooms.</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="hunting-for-dracula.castle.jpg" title="Dennis, Carlos and I outside the Pele&#x219; Castle" alt="Dennis, Carlos and I outside the Pele&#x219; Castle"><p class="media__caption">Dennis, Carlos and I outside the Pele&#x219; Castle</p></div><h2 id="going-back">Going back</h2><p>I was impressed by what Romania has to offer. Romania has fields, forest, mountains, rivers, old historical cities, diverse wildlife, fantastic kitchen and friendly people. A big thanks to Andrei for taking care of us for the whole stay. I am definitely going back!</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" data-src="hunting-for-dracula.group-picture.jpg" title="Exploring the city of Bra&#x219;ov - here at the main square" alt="Exploring the city of Bra&#x219;ov - here at the main square"><p class="media__caption">Exploring the city of Bra&#x219;ov - here at the main square</p></div><h2 id="p-s-food">P.S. Food</h2><p>Before rounding off, I would just like to highlight a few culinary experiences! The Romanian kitchen is its own. I can best describe it as: garlic, pork, potatoes, beans, love and more garlic.</p><div class="media group"><img class="media__image" data-src="hunting-for-dracula.pork.jpg" title="Smoked pork leg with beans" alt="Smoked pork leg with beans"> <img class="media__image" data-src="hunting-for-dracula.ribs.jpg" title="Pork ribs" alt="Pork ribs"> <img class="media__image" data-src="hunting-for-dracula.soup.jpg" title="Bean soup served in a bread" alt="Bean soup served in a bread"> <img class="media__image" data-src="hunting-for-dracula.cutlet.jpg" title="A nice pork cutlet" alt="A nice pork cutlet"><p class="media__caption">A few classics - smoked pork leg, ribs, soup in bread and a cutlet</p></div></main></article><div class="navigation__back"><a href="/">Go to main page</a></div><script src="frontend/dist/scripts/dist-vendor.min.js"></script><script src="frontend/dist/scripts/dist.min.js"></script></body></html>
