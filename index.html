While most master the basic Git commands, many get insecure when things get just a tiny bit complicated. This tutorial will take you through the basic Git usage and present some typical use cases. I will provide a bit of theory, but the primary focus of this tutorial is to provide practical examples.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learn-by-doing\">Learn by doing</h2>\n<p>I have a set up a small project that we will use throughout this tutorial. Let&#39;s get our hands dirty - run the following commands:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\"># Create the example directory (you can create it wherever you want)\nmkdir -p ~/Desktop/fit-with-git\n\n# Navigate to the example directory\ncd ~/Desktop/fit-with-git\n\n# Create an index file\necho &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Fit with Git&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot; &gt; index.html\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"installing-git\">Installing Git</h2>\n<p>Install Git following the instructions <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\">here</a>. Once installed, verify that <code>git</code> is accessible on the command line. Run <code>git --help</code> to see the available commands.</p>\n<h2 id=\"initializing-git\">Initializing Git</h2>\n<p>You can now initialize Git in your project by running <code>git init</code> (you need to be in the example directory). This will create a <code>.git</code> folder in your project; dot files are hidden by default. Run <code>ls -la</code> to show hidden files in the directory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-git-works\">How Git works</h2>\n<p>Git works by taking snapshots of your project at different points in time. This is different from other version control systems that work by storing only file changes. A Git project consists of three different sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Repository</li>\n<li>Working directory</li>\n<li>Staging area</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <em>repository</em> is the <code>.git</code> directory that we just created. It stores all the metadata and all the snapshots of your project. The <em>working directory</em> represents a single version of the project that you are currently working on. Lastly, the <em>staging area</em> holds the changed files that will be permanently stored in your repository after next commit. For further details dive into <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics\">this article</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tracking-and-commiting\">Tracking and commiting</h2>\n<p>A good starting point for working in a git project is to run the <code>git status</code> command. Running this in our project we see that <code>index.html</code> is listed as being <em>untracked</em>. This means that the file is currently not under version control - to include it run <code>git add index.html</code>. Now running <code>git status</code> again we see that the files is listed under <em>changes to be committed</em>. Running <code>git commit -m &quot;My first commit&quot;</code> we now permanently store the <code>index.html</code> in our repository.</p>\n<p>Now open up your editor and modify the <code>index.html</code> to the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-html\">&lt;!-- We are making the HTML a little prettier and adding a &lt;p&gt; tag --&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;Fit with Git&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Work hard, Git hard!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>We have now modified the file. You can see the modifications to the file by running <code>git diff</code>, which outputs all deletions and insertions. Running <code>git add index.html</code> followed by <code>git commit -m &quot;Added a paragraph of text&quot;</code> permanently stores the modified file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-with-branches\">Working with branches</h2>\n<p>Branches are common in the world of version control systems. Basically, a branch is a way for you to diverge from the main line of the project and work on another line separately. After working on another branch you merge the changes back into the main line, which in Git lingo is called the <em>master branch</em>. Let&#39;s say that we are to add some Javascript logic for toggling text to our <code>index.html</code>, but would like to do it on a new branch.</p>\n<p>Firstly we run <code>git branch text-toggle</code> to create the new branch. To get a listing of available branches, run <code>git branch -v</code>. Using the <code>-v</code> flag we see the last commit made to each respective branch. Changing to our <em>text-toggle branch</em> is easy, just run <code>git checkout text-toggle</code>. Let&#39;s implement the feature on our branch:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-html\">&lt;!-- We have added some CSS, JS and a &lt;button&gt; element--&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;\n    .hidden {\n      display: none;\n    }\n  &lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;Fit with Git&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Work hard, Git hard!&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;button id=&quot;toggle-text&quot;&gt;Toggle&lt;/button&gt;\n\n  &lt;script&gt;\n    var btn = document.getElementById(&#39;toggle-text&#39;);\n    btn.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function(event) {\n      var text = document.querySelector(&#39;p&#39;);\n      text.classList.toggle(&#39;hidden&#39;);\n    });\n  &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now add the changed file to staging and commit it in just one command <code>git commit -a -m &quot;Added text-toggle feature&quot;</code>. We are now ready to merge the <em>text-toggle branch</em> with our <em>master branch</em>. This is achieved with the commands <code>git checkout master</code> and <code>git merge text-toggle</code>. We are changing back to the <em>master branch</em> and merging it with the <em>text-toggle branch</em>. We finish off by deleting our <em>text-toggle branch</em> <code>git branch -d text-toggle</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"merge-conflicts\">Merge conflicts</h3>\n<p>Merging branches are not always as simple. Sometimes you have modified the same code in two different branches that you wish to merge. This results in a merge conflict. Imagine the following scenario - on two different branches, we have modified the text of the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag. Let&#39;s set it up.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\"># Create both branches (both off the master branch)\ngit branch feature-1\ngit branch feature-2\n\n# Checkout the first branch and modify the &lt;h1&gt; in the index.html to say ´Git rocks´\ngit checkout feature-1\ngit commit -a -m &quot;Changed text to git rocks&quot;\n\n# Checkout the second branch and modify the &lt;h1&gt; in the index.html to say ´Git sucks´\ngit checkout feature-2\ngit commit -a -m &quot;Changed text to git sucks&quot;\n\n# Checkout the master branch and merge with the first branch\ngit checkout master\ngit merge feature-1\n\n# Attempt to merge with the second branch\ngit merge feature-2\n</code></pre>\n<p>Doing this we encounter a merge conflict since Git doesn&#39;t know whether to choose <em>rocks</em> or <em>sucks</em> as the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> text. The error looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-shell\">Auto-merging index.html\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html\nAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Going to the <code>index.html</code> we see that Git has made it easy for us:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-shell\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\n  &lt;h1&gt;Git rocks&lt;/h1&gt;\n=======\n  &lt;h1&gt;Git sucks&lt;/h1&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feature-2\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we simply delete the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> saying <em>Git sucks</em> and clean up the file. We can then commit <code>git commit -a -m &quot;Resolved &lt;h1&gt; text conflict&quot;</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rebasing\">Rebasing</h3>\n<p>We looked at the  <code>git merge</code> command as a way to combine the work on two different branches. Another way of uniting the work of two branches is to use the <code>git rebase</code> command. Imagine a branch called <em>feature</em> that is one commit ahead of the master. While you have been working on <em>feature</em>, the master branch has been under development as well and has received a few commits. Using the <code>git rebase</code> command you can apply all the new changes to master directly on the <em>feature</em> branch. Internally Git finds the latest common commit between the two branches and then continually applies all changes. Follow me on this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\"># Create and switch to the feature branch\ngit branch feature\ngit checkout feature\n\n# Modify some files and commit the changes\ngit commit -a -m &quot;Added an &#39;about us&#39; text&quot;\n\n# Master has changed since we created the feature branch; we want those changes.\ngit rebase master\n\n# Switch to master and merge the two branches (this is now easy, since &#39;feature&#39; has been rebased with master)\ngit checkout master\ngit merge feature\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"stashing-changes\">Stashing changes</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you find yourself in the situation of working on a certain issue, when something else requires your attention. In such a case, you can&#39;t just change branch, as your <em>dirty</em> working directory will follow you to the other branch. Ideally, you would like to temporarily revert all changes in your working directory and apply them again later. This can be achieved with the <code>git stash</code> command.</p>\n<p>Now go to the <code>index.html</code> and make a modification. By running <code>git status</code>, we can see that <code>index.html</code> has been modified. To stash the changes simply run <code>git stash</code> followed by <code>git status</code> to see that your working directory is clean again. You can list all stashed changes with <code>git stash list</code>. The output will look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-plain\">stash@{0}: WIP on test: 0232533 Resolved &lt;h1&gt; text conflict\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that the changes has an index of zero; you can store many changes at once and apply them using <code>git stash apply stash@{INDEX}</code>. Additionally the listing shows you the last commit before the changes were stashed. By running <code>git stash apply</code> Git applies the latest stash.</p>\n<p>Stashing does by default only stash changes to already tracked files. This means that a new file will still be in your working directory. To stash both tracked and untracked files run the command <code>git stash -u</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-github\">Using Github</h2>\n<p>It is commonly believed that Git only works with <a href=\"https://github.com/\">Github</a>. This is not true as Github only provides a web interface and cloud storage for your project - Git can be used entirely on its own on your machine as we have done throughout the tutorial. However because using Github is so widely used (and <strong>awesome</strong>) we need to add it to your developer tool belt! Without further ado let&#39;s create you an account on Github - click <a href=\"https://github.com/\">here</a> and come back when you are done.</p>\n<p>Go to your profile and create a new repository. We will now link this repository to our local project so we can start pushing code to the cloud. The repository on Github will become the <em>remote</em> to our project. Firstly, let&#39;s try to list our current remote by running <code>git remote</code> - it doesn&#39;t print anything, since our project does not yet have a remote. Add the remote by running <code>git remote add origin https://github.com/lindekaer/fit-with-git.git</code> (use the link to your own repository). Now running <code>git remote --verbose</code> you see something like:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-plain\">origin  https://github.com/lindekaer/fit-with-git.git (fetch)\norigin  https://github.com/lindekaer/fit-with-git.git (push)\n</code></pre>\n<p>So what does this mean? The name <em>origin</em> is just a commonly used shortname. You can however use whatever name your prefer. You are able to both fetch (download data) and push (upload data) to the repository.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pushing-and-pulling\">Pushing and pulling</h3>\n<p>Let&#39;s push all our local data to the master branch on our remote <code>git push origin master</code>. It is annoying to constantly specify both <em>origin</em> and <em>master</em> when pushing to the remote. To make it easier, we can set the remote&#39;s master branch as our local master branch&#39;s <em>upstream</em> <code>git push --set-upstream origin master</code>. You can now just run <code>git push</code> in the future. Pulling data is just as easy, simply run <code>git pull</code> to get the newest data from the Github repository.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tips-and-tricks\">Tips and tricks</h2>\n<p>I would like to share a few simple tips to make your Git life easier 🌟</p>\n<h3 id=\"git-configuration\">Git configuration</h3>\n<p>In order to tailor your Git setup to you, I recommend setting your <code>.gitconfig</code> (which you can find in your user directory). This is the global settings file. Here is an excerpt of mine:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">[user]\n  name = Theodor Lindekaer\n  email = theodor.lindekaer@gmail.com\n[core]\n  editor = vim\n[color]\n  ui = true\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"aliases\">Aliases</h3>\n<p>I heavily use aliases to speed up my work. You will find yourself using the same commands over and over again, so aliases are a good investment - I promise.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\"># Add this to your .bash_profile (if using bash shell) or .zshrc (if using z-shell)\nalias gs=&#39;git status&#39;\nalias gc=&#39;git commit -m&#39;\nalias gp=&#39;git push&#39;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"snippets\">Snippets</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\"># Gives an excellent overview of the commit history\ngit log --oneline --decorate\n\n# Equivalent to &#39;un-commit&#39;\ngit reset HEAD^\n\n# Delete a remote branch\ngit push origin --delete test\n\n# Change the name of a branch\ngit branch -m [OLD_NAME] [NEW_NAME]\n\n# Get all remote branches\ngit fetch --all\n\n# Clear staging area and rewrite working tree from specified commit\n# You can also write HEAD instead of [COMMIT], to reset to latest commit\ngit reset --hard [COMMIT]\n\n# Change the message of your last commit\ngit commit --amend -m &quot;New and correct message&quot;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"title":"Docker 101","category":"Development","date":"March 17th, 2016","author":"Theodor Lindekaer","slug":"docker-101","description":"There are plenty of resources on Docker out there, but not all tutorials are equally clear.

I have therefore decided to provide a walkthrough of setting up a Docker project from scratch. </p>\n<h2 id=\"step-1-server-setup\">Step 1 - Server setup</h2>\n<p class=\"article__notice\">You are now able to run Docker directly on your Mac (running a small Linux image in the background). Download the new Mac OS Docker software.</p>\n\n<p>Spin up a virtual server. You can use <a href=\"https://www.virtualbox.org/\">Virtualbox</a>, but I decided to spin up a virtual 64 bit Centos server on Digital Ocean with 512 MB memory and a 20 GB disk (this server will in Docker context be referred to as the <em>host machine</em>). Prepare the server with the following commands:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\"># List kernel version - it MUST be 3.10 or above\nuname -r\n\n# Update system packages\nsudo yum update\n\n# Add yum repository\nsudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/docker.repo &lt;&lt;-&#39;EOF&#39;\n[dockerrepo]\nname=Docker Repository\nbaseurl=https://yum.dockerproject.org/repo/main/centos/$releasever/\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://yum.dockerproject.org/gpg\nEOF\n\n# Install Docker\nsudo yum install docker-engine\n\n# Start the Docker daemon\nsudo service docker start\n</code></pre>\n<p>This should make it possible for you to run the <code>docker</code> command from the command line on your server. Try <code>docker --help</code> for a listing of commands. Before we proceed you need to know the differences between these Docker concepts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Container</strong> is a an isolated environment in which software can be run. They only exists as long as their internal processes are running</li>\n<li><strong>Image</strong> is a technical blueprint for a container. You <em>run</em> an image to launch a container. Images can be composed in layered manner by multiple images</li>\n<li><strong>Docker daemon</strong> the Docker process that is used to configure and deploy containers. Also known as <em>Docker engine</em> or <em>Docker runtime</em></li>\n<li><strong>Docker client</strong> the CLI to communicate with the Docker daemon; `docker build is an example</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"step-2-downloading-images\">Step 2 - Downloading images</h2>\n<p>We are now able to start our first container. I will show you how to start a a Nginx and a MySQL container. In order to get up and running quickly, we are going to use the official Dockerfiles for both Nginx and MySQL stored on <strong>Dockerhub</strong> (equivalent to Github, but for Dockerfiles). You can store your own Dockerfiles in the cloud by signing up at <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/\">hub.docker.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Now we are ready to pull the Dockerfiles using <code>docker pull nginx</code> and <code>docker pull mysql</code>. To see the images that we have just downloaded, run <code>docker images</code>. Verify that you can see the image for both Nginx and MySQL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"step-3-starting-containers\">Step 3 - Starting containers</h2>\n<p>You are now ready to start some containers. In order for our Nginx server to serve some HTML, we need to create a HTML file. On your host machine run the following commands: </p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\"># Create a directory to store the HTML file\nmkdir -p /var/www\n\n# Create an index page\necho &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello from host machine!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot; &gt; /var/www/index.html\n</code></pre>\n<p>Read carefully through the code below before firing up the containers. Additionally, run <code>docker run --help</code> for parameter explanations.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\"># run    = starts the container process\n# -d     = detach the container and run in the background\n# -p     = map port from host machine to container\n# --name = name your container\n# -e     = set environment variable\n# -v     = mount a drive from the host machine to the container\ndocker run -d -p 80:80 -v /var/www/:/usr/share/nginx/html --name &quot;nginx-server&quot; nginx\ndocker run -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Xa8j3cs10 --name &quot;mysql-server&quot; mysql\n</code></pre>\n<p>Containers should be regarded as immutable as they don&#39;t change after initialization. Furthermore, they can quickly be stopped, removed and started again. They are therefore not suitable for storing data. When working with MySQL, you want to make sure that the data written to the database is persisted. This can be achieved by mounting a directory from the host machine to the container.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\"># Stop the MySQL container\ndocker stop &quot;mysql-server&quot;\n\n# Remove the MySQL container\ndocker rm &quot;mysql-server&quot;\n\n# Create directory on host machine to hold data\nmkdir -p /var/data\n\n# Start the MySQL container again (this time writing data to the host machine)\ndocker run -d -p 3306:3306 -v /var/data:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Xa8j3cs10 --name &quot;mysql-server&quot; mysql\n</code></pre>\n<p>Verify that the containers have started by running <code>docker ps</code>. </p>\n<h2 id=\"step-4-testing-containers\">Step 4 - Testing containers</h2>\n<p>As described above, we have mapped the host machine&#39;s port 80 to port 80 on the Nginx container. Visit the IP address of the host machine and you should be welcomed by your own <code>index.html</code>! You have now successfully started a Nginx container and are able to control it through Docker commands.</p>\n<p>In order to test the MySQL container try to connect using <code>root</code> as username and your chosen password.

We decided to dedicate one month to walking the Camino de Santiago. Before we knew it, we had met many wonderful people that would turn out to become some of our closest friends.</p>\n<h2 id=\"history\">History</h2>\n<p>Since the Middle Ages pilgrims have been walking towards Santiago as it is believed that the remains of St. James are buried there; hence the English name St. James&#39;s Way. The symbol for the Camino is a scallop shell - in the Middle Ages, bringing back a scallop shell was the proof for having visited the Atlantic Coast. The scallop shell also holds great symbolic power, as the grooves in the shell meet at the same point and thereby symbolizes the joint goal of reaching the shrine in Santiago.</p>\n<p>The camino is gaining a lot of popularity in recent times. Today more than 200,000 start the pilgrimage towards Santiago, while only few attempted the same in the 1980s. Since 1987 the Camino de Santiago has been present on UNESCO&#39;s list of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site\">world heritages sites</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-pilgrimage\">The pilgrimage</h2>\n<p>We decided to walk Camino Francés (there are <a href=\"http://www.caminoguides.com/route.html\">many different caminos</a>), which starts in the small French town <strong>St. Jean Pied de Port</strong> and ends in <strong>Santiago de Compostela</strong>. The total route amounts to roughly 800 kilometers. We also planned to walk an additional 90 kilometers to the city of <strong>Fisterra</strong>, which plays a central role in the pilgrimage. In pre-Christian times Fisterra was regarded as the <em>end of the world</em> due to its western location and proximity to the endless Atlantic ocean.</p>\n<div id=\"map1\" data-lat=\"42.9767345\" data-lng=\"-4.402924\" data-zoom=\"6\" data-type=\"streets\">\n  <div data-lat=\"43.1569752\" data-lng=\"-1.251297\" data-label=\"St. Jean Pied de Port\"></div>\n  <div data-lat=\"42.8802036\" data-lng=\"-8.5622792\" data-label=\"Santiago de Compostela\"></div>\n  <div data-lat=\"42.9081176\" data-lng=\"-9.2720002\" data-label=\"Fisterra\"></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>When starting out in St. Jean Pied de Port we received a hiking guide suggesting daily hikes all the way to Santiago. It was suggested to walk an average of 23 kilometers per day and thus reach Santiago in 35 days. The number of kilometers that one is able to walk every day highly depends on the terrain and the weather. We experienced extremes in both ends - walking in 45 ℃ from Pamplona and traversing the steep Pyrenees. It was a great comfort to have the guide at hand for looking ahead while walking, but we didn&#39;t strictly follow it. We ended up walking a bit ahead and completed the camino in just 28 days.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"pyrenees.jpg\" title=\"The beautiful view from the Pyrenees on our first morning\">\n</div>\n\n<p>Walking the camino, you are taken from sight to sight. Never once do you have to worry whether you could experience something more elsewhere; the camino is packed with experiences and takes your pass the most adorable villages, magnificent churches and lively town squares. It is therefore recommended to leave behind the tourist mindset and just indulge the camino experiences coming your way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accommodation\">Accommodation</h2>\n<p>Throughout the pilgrimage you find plenty of opportunities for accommodation. In most cities, you find hostels that are publicly owned and often a bit cheaper than the private alternatives. Additionally many churches and monasteries along the way open their doors to pilgrims. We found these experiences to be the most memorable and provide the most authentic experiences. The prices range from 5-15 EUR per night (often including a simple meal).</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"group.jpg\" title=\"Happily wearing our sandals after a long day on the road. Time to rest for the night.\">\n</div>\n\n<p>Staying for the night is a wonderful opportunity to get to know the other pilgrims. It was not unusual to sleep 20 people in the same room and engaging in conversations was therefore inevitable. If you desire more comfort, many hostels offer both private and double rooms. Despite it being hard to pick, here are a few suggestions for hostels worth a visit:</p>\n<!-- - [] (In Santo Domingo de la Calzada; a true authentic monastery experience) -->\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://alberguesanmiguel.com/en/inicio-2/\">Albergue San Miguel</a> (one day hike from Léon)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hsanmartinpinario.com/\">Hospederia San Martín Pinario</a> (ask for a pilgrims room; there is also an ordinary hotel)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"people\">People</h2>\n<p>On the Camino people are everything. The camino is a special journey; the daily grind is left at home, the phone barely has signal and every day passes by in a gentle pace of memorable moments. On top of this, you stay active for the entire day and spend every moment in nature. This, I believe, brings forth the best in people.</p>\n<p>The motivations for walking the camino are as manyfold as the number of places on your feet where you can have blisters. Some people have faced a life-changing event at home and seek the contemplation of the open road, while others seek out the physical challenge of walking nonstop for one month. Personally, I saw the camino as an opportunity to do something completely different and spend some quality time with Andrei.</p>\n<div class=\"media group\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"break.jpg\" title=\"Taking a break after descending from the Mountain of Forgiveness\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"iron-pilgrim.jpg\" title=\"Hanging out with Klara, Jessie and Marie\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"family.jpg\" title=\"A family photo\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"leon.jpg\" title=\"Sitting at the central square of Léon\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"statue.jpg\" title=\"Posing at a pilgrim's statue\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"water-and-wine.jpg\" title=\"The amazing taps - on with water and one with wine\">\n  <p class=\"media__caption\">The pure and sincere encounterings of the camino make the experience. With everyone walking towards the same goal on the same conditions a sense of family arises.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>It has been wonderful staying in touch with my friends from the camino. On the camino you meet many other pilgrims every single day and it is impossible to stay in touch with everyone. In the context of our society&#39;s constant and pervasive networking (yes, I am guilty), these one-time spontaneous good deeds and great moments hold a lot of beauty - at home, such are unfortunately far too rare. This made a tremendous impression on me and I have tried my best to bring it back home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"religion\">Religion</h2>\n<p>Given the nature of the camino being a pilgrimage, the topic of religion is omnipresent. I started the camino with my rational, Scandinavian, fact-driven mind equipped with a strong denial of transcendent powers. This turned out to give rise to many interesting and intense discussions. </p>\n<p>One of my greatest struggles was to understand how one could possibly believe that all the biblical figures and events wasn&#39;t just fiction. I quickly realized this emphasis lacked nuance and prevented the discussion to depart any further. I greatly benefited from many long discussions with my dear friend Karel, a strongly devoted Christian fighting for unity through <a href=\"http://www.tlig.org/\">TLIG</a>, who opened my eyes to the symbolic meaning of biblical references. Digging more into religious symbolism I read <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35519.The_Power_of_Myth\">The Power of Myth</a> by Joseph Campbell - this book is a <strong>must read</strong> for anyone wanting to nuance their view on religion and was a perfect match for the pilgrimage. </p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"burgos-cathedral.jpg\" title=\"The breathtaking cathedral of Burgos\">\n</div>\n\n<p>Being more aware of religion than in my daily life, I started noticing the warmth, compassion and brotherhood with which religious people met on the camino. Two people who prior to the meeting had been total strangers suddenly had a strong emotional bond and the same frame of reference. As an atheist, one cannot avoid envying this. In essence, the camino made me aware of the positive aspects of religion. This was achieved mostly by self-discovery fueled by deep conversations with people on the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"culinary-adventures\">Culinary adventures</h2>\n<p>I am admittedly a foodie and the topic of my culinary experiences can therefore not be left out. The Spanish cuisine offers a range of delicious goodies including paella, tortilla, jamón serrano, pulpo, great wine and of course an endless range of tapas. </p>\n<p>A typical day started out with a cup of strong coffee and a tortilla sandwich, which was usually offered at almost every restaurant and cafe. When having lunch and dinner many restaurants offered a <em>pilgrims menu</em> consisting of basic and nutritious dishes. This was most often the cheapest alternative at around 10 EUR for two courses and a drink. Due to the constant physical effort, the tastiness of every meal was greatly amplified and made even the smallest bite a memorable moment.</p>\n<div class=\"media group\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"paella.jpg\" title=\"A delicious paella served on our last night in Santiago\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"drinks.jpg\" title=\"Celebrating our amazing experiences with a drink in Santiago\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"pasta.jpg\" title=\"Sharing a meal together at a hostel\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"beer.jpg\" title=\"A refreshing midday beer\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"tapas.jpg\" title=\"One of the better pilgrim menus, tapas!\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"clams.jpg\" title=\"The delicious jackknife clam served at Fisterra\">\n  <p class=\"media__caption\">The classic paella, tapas and jackknife clam. Beer, wine or drinks as a much needed side order.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>At many hostels there kitchen facilities were available. Some pilgrims cook for themselves every single day, which is the cheapest way of getting by. We cooked 4-5 times in total; when arriving late in the afternoon we sought the comfort of having our meals prepared.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-back\">Looking back</h2>\n<p>It is impossible to conclude and make a final remark about my experiences on the camino. I can however only say that I believe everyone should give it a go. The only prerequisite for being generously rewarded when walking the camino is having an open mind. To me the camino marked a period of change in my life; I believe the pace of walking and the long hours on the road gave rise to being brutally responsive and honest to myself.</p>\n<p>Tie your shoes and get on the road.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"end.jpg\" title=\"We made it to the end\">\n</div>\n\n"},{"title":"Upplandsleden 🇸🇪","category":"Travel","date":"April 18th, 2016","author":"Theodor Lindekaer","slug":"upplandsleden","description":"Living in Scandinavia, you are surrounded by amazing hiking opportunities.

Part of the entrance fee goes as a direct donation to the backing foundation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sigi-hoara\">Sigișhoara</h3>\n<p>The city of Sigișhoara is on the UNESCO list of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site\">World Heritage Sites</a>. The old city center behind the city walls boasts of well-preserved medieval buildings. In particular, we enjoyed visiting <em>Biserica din Deal</em> church on top of the hill. Also, the main gate (previously the town hall) acted as a good viewpoint and contained a small museum. Sigișhoara is perfect for one day of historical indulgence!</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"sigishoara.jpg\" title=\"View from the main gate of Sigișhoara\">\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"parc-aventura-bra-ov\">Parc Aventura Brașov</h3>\n<p>In the adventure park we tried tree top walking. Wearing a safety harness (and attached to security lines) we moved from tree to tree by passing obstacles - these obstacles went from slacklining to rope climbing. It was <strong>so much fun</strong> and really got the adrenalin rushing. The park offered many different courses of varying difficulty, so there was something for everyone.</p>\n<p>I was very close to completing the black course, but suddenly a thunder storm with fierce rain was above us. We were told to stay at the platform and had to rappel down from the tree. Wow, that was quite an experience!

The castle was richly adorned both on the in and outside. It was built between 1873 and 1914 and was intended to serve as a royal summer residence. The name of the castle is derived from the small Peleș river that runs nearby. </p>\n<p>The castle&#39;s location is close to perfect - located in the middle of a spectacular mountain scenery with thick forests. The castle itself is placed in a glade in the midst of this. We visited the castle in heavy rain, but were not less impressed with the whole setting.

The trail starts at the outskirts of Barcelona, right behind a campus area for the University of Barcelona. It starts off with a bit of a climb, which quickly takes you to an amazing viewpoint. We were immediately impressed by the condition of the trail - great dusty and rocky path, but still well maintained and easy to follow. This feeling did not cease at any point during the whole hike.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"starting-out.jpg\" title=\"The beginning of GR 6 in Barcelona\">\n</div>\n\n<p>We generally kept a good pace and had few breaks.

Approaching the small city Ullastrell, we decided to head there in search of accommodation. We were quickly greeted by a friendly local guy, who gave us directions for the local hostel. As we headed for the hostel, we encountered even more locals who all pointed us towards the small town square. On the square, we met the same guy, who initially helped us out. It turned out that he was the vice mayor of the city!</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"montserrat-in-the-distance.jpg\" title=\"The beautiful view of Montserrat from Ullastrell\">\n</div>\n\n<p>Before we knew it, he had opened the door to the town hall and guided us to the small dormitory on the backside. The hostel had just opened few weeks prior to our arrival. Ullastrell turned out to me an amazing local experience. The hostel was great, the local bar was vibrant and packed, and the small supermarket offered everything we desired.</p>\n<h2 id=\"montserrat\">Montserrat</h2>\n<p>Montserrat is an impressive mountain that pops from the surrounding landscape, with the highest summit reaching 1236 meters.\nThe name Montserrat means <em>saw mountain</em>, which very well describes the serrated look of the mountain. Because of the steep cliff sides Montserrat is a popular destination for climbers and hikers. Before we started our ascend, we had a lunch break in Collbató by the foot of the mountain. The city was idyllic and turned out to be a perfect oasis to relax before our struggles.</p>\n<div class=\"media wide\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"view.jpg\" title=\"The view from the Montserrat trail\">\n</div>\n\n<p>The trail leading up Montserrat to the Santa Maria de Montserrat monastery was <strong>awesome</strong>.

The hike consists of 15 stages and it is commonly recommended to do one stage a day. However, due to other holiday plans I was short on time. To my delight, I found that many people have completed the GR 20 in much less than 15 days. Of particular inspiration for my planning was <a href=\"http://c8h10n4o2.org/walking/gr20/\">Pete&#39;s blog</a>. I settled on walking south bound and doing double stages every day.</p>\n<p>A quick note - <em>refuge</em> is the French word for a small hostel. Typically a small mountain hut with beds, camping grounds and the possibility to buy food.</p>\n<h3 id=\"first-day-calenzana-to-refuge-d-ortu-di-u-piobbu-stage-1-\">First day - Calenzana to Refuge d&#39;Ortu di u Piobbu (stage 1)</h3>\n<p>I arrived to Calvi around 10:00 and grabbed a taxi straight to Calenzana (the price was approx. EUR 40). I went to the local supermarket and bought a lunch consisting of pizza and yoghourt - I also bought hiking snacks for the first days. After having eaten I started the hike; the trail can be reached by walking to the left of bar &quot;Le GR 20&quot;.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"calenzana-square.jpg\" title=\"The small square of Calenzana. Fill your water here in the fountain\">\n</div>\n\n<p>The ascent started from the first step and the heat was fierce. I quickly learned to pay attention to the GR signs, as I missed one and walked 20 minutes in the wrong direction - whoops!</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"small-sign.jpg\" title=\"Pay attention to the small signs\">\n</div>\n\n<p>When climbing the mountains the backwards view of Calvi was nothing but stunning. Towards the end of the stage I spotted the refuge on the other side of the valley. As I also learned that day, being able to see your destination does not mean that you are close.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"calvi-view.jpg\" title=\"Amazing view of the Calvi bay area\">\n</div>\n\n<p>At the refuge I paid for a camp site (EUR 7) and ordered the full dinner menu (EUR 20). I had to be creative when setting up my tent as the ground was very rocky - as my Swiss companion, Marcel, showed me, bringing extra rope for tying your tent to rocks is a must.</p>\n<h3 id=\"second-day-refuge-d-ortu-di-u-piobbu-to-haut-asco-stage-2-and-3-\">Second day - Refuge d&#39;Ortu di u Piobbu to Haut Asco (stage 2 and 3)</h3>\n<p>I woke up at around 4:30 unable to sleep anymore. I was simply too excited. This day was of great importance, since it was my first encountering with doing a double stage. Additionally, the first stages in the north are known to be the toughest. I was in for a treat.</p>\n<p>After eating a few small yoghourts I packed my stuff and got on the move. Finding it really hard to navigate in the thick forest, I was relieved to spot a bright red backpack up the trail. It turned out to belong to an old, hardcore, French hiker called Germain. Despite him not speaking English and my French being rusty, we ended up hiking for almost all of stage 2 together.</p>\n<p>After some awesome rocky mountain traversal I reached Bocca Innuminata and took a small rest. From here on Carrozzu was only a one hour descent away.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"bocca-innuminata.jpg\" title=\"Well deserved rest at Bocca Innuminata\">\n</div>\n\n<p>In Carrozzu I had a quick lunch and an electrolyte drink. I made the mistake of leaving for Haut Asco too early and thereby climbing in the worst midday heat. Lesson learned! Right after Carrozzu you find a suspension bridge crossing a small river with small waterfalls. <em>Stop here to take a swim and enjoy life</em>, plenty of strain coming up ahead.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"suspension-bridge.jpg\" title=\"The awesome suspension bridge\">\n</div>\n\n<p>Climbing up alongside the river is challenging as the slabs of rock lack texture. There are a few sections with chains for security. Once reaching the top you find a small valley with a peaceful mountain lake - did I say swim again?</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"rocky-slabs.jpg\" title=\"There is only one way - up!\">\n</div>\n\n<p>After a little climb you reach the most amazing viewpoint. I was blown away! After a snack I started the grueling two hour descent to Haut Asco. To compensate for the struggles, you find a restaurant (that accepts credit card) in Haut Asco. I ordered the full menu and fell asleep as soon as I hit my mat.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"haut-asco-tent.jpg\" title=\"My rather sloppy tent setup at Haut Asco\">\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"third-day-haut-asco-to-refuge-de-ciottulu-di-i-mori-stage-4-and-5-\">Third day - Haut Asco to Refuge de Ciottulu di i Mori (stage 4 and 5)</h3>\n<p>Waking up I immediately felt the hard work from yesterday&#39;s hike. I turned off the alarm and snoozed until 06:00. Quickly packing my stuff, I left shortly after. The first climb of the day was for Monte Cinto, which also is the highest point on all of Corsica. The trail started out in a nice pine forest, but as I gained altitude the trees were replaced by big slabs of rock. Occasionally chains were encountered during the climb.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"going-up.jpg\" title=\"The beautiful view from Haut Asco towards Monte Cinto\">\n</div>\n\n<p>I went fast and passed a few groups. About one hour before reaching the top plateau, I encountered a bit of snow. I could imagine the traversal being much more difficult earlier in the year.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"snow.jpg\" title=\"Yes, just a bit of snow\">\n</div>\n\n<p>From the plateau it was possible to climb to the peak of Monte Cinto. Doing so required approximately two hours going back and forth. I skipped it and pushed on for the end of the stage at Refuge de Tighjettu. Reaching the hut I was smashed. The descent was tough and I severely lacked some hiking poles. I decided to call it a day, but after having had a huge lunch I felt energized and decided to head for Refuge de Ciottulu di i Mori.</p>\n<p>Half of the stage went on a mostly flat forest path, but suddenly it turned almost vertical. It was a steep climb and not the best way to finish off the day. Taking a few small breaks during the climb I managed to get to the top. From here I could see the refuge. Only 30 minutes later I was asleep with my belly full of spaghetti.</p>\n<div class=\"media group\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"spaghetti.jpg\" title=\"Simple but good meal\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"tent-chill.jpg\" title=\"Chilling in the tent at Refuge de Ciottulu di i Mori\">\n  <p class=\"media__caption\">A simple meal and a bit of relaxation</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"fourth-day-refuge-de-ciottulu-di-i-mori-to-refuge-de-manganu-stage-6-and-7-\">Fourth day - Refuge de Ciottulu di i Mori to Refuge de Manganu (stage 6 and 7)</h3>\n<p>Waking up I felt good. I had completed two days of double stages in the northern part. Confident in knowing I would get to Conca, I packed my stuff and boiled spaghetti to bring for lunch. I did not carry any guidebook or map, so my day to day planning relied on talking to other hikers. Two guys (coming from the south) told me that the next stage was very short and easy and the next quite a lot longer. With this in mind I started out.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"easy-day.jpg\" title=\"Nice and flat terrain from the morning\">\n</div>\n\n<p>After three hours of hiking I expected to see the refuge just around every corner - it just never was. On my sixth hour I got to know that a hotel named Castellu di Verghio, that I had passed earlier in the morning, actually was considered the end of a stage. Without knowing I had begun yet another double stage hike heading for Refuge de Manganu.</p>\n<p>I passed the beautiful Lac de Nino lake and thought to myself that Refuge de Manganu had to be close. However, still two hours of hiking in fairly flat terrain remained. I would later be told that the double stage (commonly walked together and therefore considered as one) has a length of 23 kilometers - the longest on the GR 20.</p>\n<p>I stopped for a little while at a local bergerie (small family-owned shop) to have a drink. To my luck I meet two wonderful Norwegian women, Wenche and Tori, who were planning to hike two additional stages past Manganu the next couple of days.</p>\n<p>Arriving at Refuge de Manganu shortly after I met Wenche and Tori again. I was running short on cash and with no ATMs on the whole route, I was planning to cut it short and stop in Vizzavona. Fortunately they were kind enough to lend me EUR 70 and even invited me to their table for dinner. I am very thankful for their support and care!</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"love-and-support.jpg\" title=\"Wenche and Tori at Refuge de Manganu\">\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"fifth-day-refuge-de-manganu-to-refuge-de-l-onda-stage-8-and-9-\">Fifth day - Refuge de Manganu to Refuge de l&#39;Onda (stage 8 and 9)</h3>\n<p>When I woke up I was thrilled. Thanks to Wenche and Tori I was back in the game and heading for Conca. I started out at 06:00 and began the climb. I planned on reaching Refuge de Pietra Piana for lunch and subsequently head for Refuge de l&#39;Onda. The hike was diverse and changed from rock climbing to casual walking in green valleys between the peaks. I arrived to Pietra Piana within only five hours and went straight to the small shop to buy a can of cassoulet (French stew with beans, sausage and meats). Lovely lunch with the most spectacular view.</p>\n<div class=\"media group\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"cassoulet.jpg\" title=\"Simple but good meal\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"pietra-piana.jpg\" title=\"Refuge de Pietra Piana\">\n  <p class=\"media__caption\">Cassoulet by the Pietra Piana hut</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>From Pietra Piana one has the choice between a high and a low pass both leading to Refuge de l&#39;Onda. The low pass descends to a green valley and ends with a small climb, while the high pass maintains the altitude and follows the mountain range. I opted for the latter. The high pass was very rough but stunningly beautiful and I enjoyed every step except for a the last 40 minutes of descending. Arriving to the refuge I could hardly believe my own eyes - a lawn! Finally I had the opportunity to set up my tent with all pegs. I cooked a huge portion of pasta and went to bed early.</p>\n<div class=\"media group\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"mountain-of-pasta.jpg\" title=\"A mountain of pasta\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"tent-on-lawn.jpg\" title=\"The tent on the lawn\">\n  <p class=\"media__caption\">Perfect place to camp</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"sixth-day-refuge-de-l-onda-to-bergeries-de-capannelle-stage-10-and-11-\">Sixth day - Refuge de l&#39;Onda to Bergeries de Capannelle (stage 10 and 11)</h3>\n<p>I decided to sleep in and planned to leave at 07:00. The day before, I had briefly talked with another hiker, Nikolas, who also stopped for the night in Refuge de l&#39;Onda. He invited me for breakfast and we hiked together towards Vizzavona.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"nikolas.jpg\" title=\"Nikolas and I heading towards Vizzavona\">\n</div>\n\n<p>It stage started out with a steep ascent towards Bocca du Porco. From the top, there was only one way - down. The descent starts out steep and rocky but quickly turns into an easier forest path. About two and a half hours later, we arrived to Vizzavona. I had personally been looking forward to this stop, as it marked the end of the northern section of GR 20 (and you could buy pizzas and beer ... by credit card!).</p>\n<p>It was sad to say goodbye to Nikolas, who had to take the train from Vizzavona, as he was heading home to Paris. I pushed on to complete yet another stage ending at Bergeries de Capannelle. The hike felt extremely long, but I think this was due to me walking in the late afternoon and having had a humongous lunch.</p>\n<p>Eventually I made it. Bergeries de Capannelle is a ski resort during winter times. I met some great people in the cabin - we watched football at night and had some well deserved beers.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"chilling.jpg\" title=\"Having a beer for the Beligum vs. Wales football match\">\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"seventh-day-bergeries-de-capannelle-to-refuge-d-usciolu-stage-12-and-13-\">Seventh day - Bergeries de Capannelle to Refuge d&#39;Usciolu (stage 12 and 13)</h3>\n<p>Waking up in the morning I could feel a severe ache in my Achielle&#39;s tendon. It had been bugging me for a few days, but this morning it had also gotten pretty stiff. I limped to the bergerie and evaluated the situation. I had only two days left to complete the full hike, but on the other hand I didn&#39;t want to run the risk of a serious injury. Having made up my mind I went to the terrace and watched the sunrise feeling in peace with stopping for now.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"sunrise.jpg\" title=\"My last sunrise on the GR 20 - for now!\">\n</div>\n\n<p>I left Bergeries de Capannelle by the mountain road - it was only a three hour walk to the main road. I decided to hitchhike my way north, which turned out to be a good decision. Within 30 minutes is was in a car with a lovely Swiss couple who drove me all the way to Corte. From there I had easy access to Calvi by train.</p>\n<h2 id=\"back-to-civilization\">Back to civilization</h2>\n<p>Ending my hike a few days earlier freed up some extra time for the beach. I decided to spend my time in the city of Calvi on the northern coast of Corsica, since this was also where I was flying home from. Calvi turned out to provide exactly what I needed - a much needed excuse for lying on the beach and eating vast amounts of food.</p>\n<div class=\"media group\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"calvi-beach.jpg\" title=\"Relaxation on the beach\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"ferry.jpg\" title=\"The ferry going to mainland France\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"supermarket.jpg\" title=\"Back in the supermarket\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"calvi-citadel.jpg\" title=\"The view of Calvi from the old citadel\">\n  <p class=\"media__caption\">Back in the comforts of civilization</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>I ended up staying at a camp site close to the beach paying only EUR 14 per night.

What a magnificent view!</p>\n<div class=\"media wide\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"calvi-panorama.jpg\" title=\"Beautiful panorama from Notre Dame de la Serra\">\n</div>\n\n<p>I also spent one day as a tourist exploring the old town.

I have never walked a trail that rough, beautiful and challenging. When I return, I will do only single stages and spend more time enjoying the superb views, swim in the lakes and rest a bit more. I felt a positive vibe along the whole trail and I only met friendly people. The hike has my greatest recommendations!</p>\n"},{"title":"Tour de Mont Blanc 🇫🇷🇮🇹🇨🇭","category":"Travel","date":"August 30th, 2016","author":"Theodor Lindekaer","slug":"tour-de-mont-blanc","description":"The Mont Blanc massif is a mountain range located partly in Switzerland, France and Italy.

This set every scene in amazing mountain surroundings.</p>\n<div id=\"map1\" data-lat=\"45.9544249\" data-lng=\"6.9329604\" data-zoom=\"8\" data-type=\"outdoors\">\n  <div data-lat=\"45.890388\" data-lng=\"6.798735\" data-label=\"Les Houches\"></div>\n  <div data-lat=\"45.822746\" data-lng=\"6.726553\" data-label=\"Les Contamines\"></div>\n  <div data-lat=\"45.697512\" data-lng=\"6.734410\" data-label=\"Les Chapieux\"></div>\n  <div data-lat=\"45.796922\" data-lng=\"6.968963\" data-label=\"Courmayeur\"></div>\n  <div data-lat=\"45.846917\" data-lng=\"7.033524\" data-label=\"Refugio Bonatti\"></div>\n  <div data-lat=\"45.933198\" data-lng=\"7.098650\" data-label=\"La Fouly\"></div>\n  <div data-lat=\"46.029700\" data-lng=\"7.117260\" data-label=\"Champex-Lac\"></div>\n  <div data-lat=\"46.057800\" data-lng=\"7.001620\" data-label=\"Col de Forclaz\"></div>\n  <div data-lat=\"45.997131\" data-lng=\"6.926501\" data-label=\"Tre Le Champ\"></div>\n  <div data-lat=\"45.923697\" data-lng=\"6.869433\" data-label=\"Chamonix\"></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"our-hike\">Our hike</h2>\n<p>I was fortunate to get invited to walk the TMB by my close friend Andrei. Him and his brother, Dennis, had had their eyes fixed on the hike for a while and decided to give it a go in the summer of 2016. We ended up going five people together: Andrei, Dennis, Victoria, Klara and I. With such great company and a world-renowned hike ahead of us, we had the perfect foundation for a great trip.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"team.jpg\" title=\"Ready to start the TMB\">\n</div>\n\n\n<p>We all flew to Geneva (Switzerland) and went by bus to Chamonix (France), which is only 7 kilometers from Les Houches. From the center of Les Houches the trail is reachable within only few minutes of walking.</p>\n<p>Our schedule allowed for quite a bit of wiggle room. We used this to the full extend and took some well-deserved rest days - one in Courmayeur (Italy) and one in Champex-Lac (Switzerland). Our journey ended up looking like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Day 1 - Les Houches to Les Contamines</li>\n<li>Day 2 - Les Contamines to Les Chapieux</li>\n<li>Day 3 - Les Chapieux to Courmayeur</li>\n<li><strong>Day 4 - Rest day in Courmayeur</strong></li>\n<li>Day 5 - Courmayeur to Refugio Bonatti</li>\n<li>Day 6 - Refugion Bonatti to La Fouly</li>\n<li>Day 7 - La Fouly to Champex-Lac</li>\n<li><strong>Day 8 - Rest day in Champex-Lac</strong></li>\n<li>Day 9 - Champex-Lac to Col de Forclaz</li>\n<li>Day 10 - Col de Forclaz to Tre Le Champ</li>\n<li>Day 11 - Tre Le Champ to Chamonix</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"map.jpg\" title=\"Planning for our day off in Courmayeur\">\n</div>\n\n<p>We brought three tents as well as cooking gear to make us independent from the hostels on the route. Additionally, it was the perfect opportunity for me to try out some of my equipement!</p>\n<h2 id=\"people-of-the-tmb\">People of the TMB</h2>\n<p>We encountered a bunch of different people on the TMB. The majority of people on the trail were hikers in all shapes and sizes; beginners going from hostel to hostel, experienced campers with heavy backpacks and ultralight hikers. The stream of hikers was occasionally interrupted by trail runners speeding ahead.</p>\n<div class=\"media wide\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"fenetre.jpg\" title=\"View from the Fenetrê d'Arpette\">\n</div>\n\n<p>We couldn&#39;t help being amazed by the trail runners completing several stages in one stretch. The Mont Blanc massif attracts extreme trail runners partly due to the diverse and rocky trails and partly to the area being the stage for the yearly Ultra-Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB) - 166 kilometers in 20 hours. Check it out <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-Trail_du_Mont-Blanc\">here</a>. Whoa, maybe next time!</p>\n<h2 id=\"food-and-accommodation\">Food and accommodation</h2>\n<p>Due to the nature of the TMB being split into stages, many hikers opted for the staying at the hostels acting as stage dividers. Due to the popularity of the hostels and the limited capacity, one should book nights ahead. The hostels are basic and often only offering dorm rooms, showers and simple meals. However, after day-long hikes it does not take much culinary creativity or luxurious accommodation to satisfy a tired hiker.</p>\n<div class=\"media group\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"grill.jpg\" title=\"Grilling by the Champex-Lac lake\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"tapas.jpg\" title=\"Tapas in Courmayeur\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"bruschetta.jpg\" title=\"Bruschetta in Courmayeur\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"cooking.jpg\" title=\"A camp classic\">\n  <p class=\"media__caption\">The trip offered everything from camp cooking to fine dining</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Food always seems to become a pivotal point for my hikes. I know nothing better than eating great quantities of good food after a day of hiking 🍕. On the TMB you have the possibility to eat at many of the hostels. <em>Think about it</em> - walking the TMB makes it possible to have both traditional Swiss raclette, great French wine and delicious Italian food almost at the same time. In case you need to buy some more down-to-earth supplies, you are often able to buy simple goods such as pasta, tomato sauce and tuna at the camp grounds. However, if you seek anything beyond the basics, make sure to stack up in the cities before heading into the mountains.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"camp.jpg\" title=\"Setting up camp close to Refugio Bonatti\">\n</div>\n\n<p>Finding a place to set up your tent is not a challenge. Most cities have camp grounds that can be used at a small fee; usually 10 EUR. In general it is not allowed to set up your tent in the wild. We did however do this on a few occasions - once outside Courmayeur and once at Bonatti.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"athletics.jpg\" title=\"Sometimes you just need to do something else than carrying your backpack\">\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>The TMB was great. It provided a lot of diversity, a moderate level of strain, plenty of opportunities to capture great views and a good vibe in general. If I was to go again, I would try to experiment with some of the other alternative routes.</p>\n"},{"title":"Hiking in Tatry Roháče 🇸🇰","category":"Travel","date":"September 5th, 2016","author":"Theodor Lindekaer","slug":"hiking-in-tatry-rohace","description":"In October 2015 I went to Tatry Roháče with my friend Karel.

The snow made the both beautiful and tranquil, but it greatly limited our possibilities for hiking - especially considering our inadequate gear. We agreed to return in the following season and go for the full hiking package.</p>\n<p>Karel and I did as planned and I have just returned from a week of hiking in Tatry Roháče close to the city of Zuberec. We went in a group of 11 people in late August.</p>\n<div id=\"map1\" data-lat=\"49.2572905\" data-lng=\"19.6321944\" data-zoom=\"5\" data-type=\"streets\">\n  <div data-lat=\"49.260516\" data-lng=\"19.614379\" data-label=\"Zuberec\"></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"tatry-roh-e\">Tatry Roháče</h2>\n<p>First off a little information about the area we visited. The Tatra mountains are located in the borderlands between Poland and Slovakia and boast of many great peaks to visit. The highest peak of the entire range is Gerlach with its 2655 meters. We stayed in Tatry Roháče, which is a part of the western Tatras. From my experience, this region is not very crowded and provides a handful of good hikes for both beginners and more experienced hikers. I enjoyed being back a second time and could easily imagine myself visiting Tatry Roháče again.</p>\n<div class=\"media wide\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"view.jpg\" title=\"A glimpse of Tatry Roháče\">\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"accommodation\">Accommodation</h2>\n<p>There are a few of different options for accomodation in the area. I have personally stayed at <a href=\"http://www.chatazverovka.sk/\">Chata Zverovka</a> and, most recently, <a href=\"http://www.sindlovec.sk/\">Penzióne Šindľovec</a>. Both hotels are very local, has a cozy atmosphere and serves good solid meals. Being forced to pick, I think Šindľovec offered slightly better rooms. We paid around 15 EUR per person every night. This included a huge breakfast with youghourt, eggs, fruit, bread and coffee. For an additional 3 EUR you could get a good lunch pack.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"upside-down.jpg\" title=\"Seeing things upside down\">\n</div>\n\n\n<p>The hosts are very friendly and usually have in-depth knowledge about the trails in the area. We have relied heavily on the recommendations that we got from day to day. Our group benefited greatly from Karel&#39;s ability to speak Slovak; without such a luxury some things might be a bit more cumbersome, but don&#39;t worry too much.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"hotel.jpg\" title=\"Klara posing in front of the hotel\">\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"hiking-opportunities\">Hiking opportunities</h2>\n<p>We did two major hikes in the Tatry Roháče region. The first hike started by taking the cable car next to Penzióne Šindľovec. We headed towards Salatin with the goal of ending by Banikovske sedlo before descending. All in all, we passed the peaks of: Brestova, Telaciarky, Salatin, Spalena, Pachol&#39;a, and Banikov. The hike was easy and had plenty of good view points along the way. We kept a decent pace, but took many breaks resulting in a total hiking time of around 8 hours.</p>\n<p>The second hike was planned according to a goal that Karel and I set during our last visit to the region. We wanted to hike the great ciruit going from Penzióne Šindľovec across Volovec, onto Ostry Roháč and several other peaks before ending at Banikov and descending down through the valley. This was a more challenging hike with quite a few sections with chains on the steep mountain sides. It took us 12 hours to complete the full circuit.</p>\n<p>For more relaxing days, one may walk around the mountain lakes (Roháče plesa) for some good views of the entire range and a handful of idyllic spots for eating lunch. Keep in mind that you do not encounter any huts or cabins when you hike in Tatry Roháče. Therefore you have to bring your own supplies for the entire day - this is no problem as a lunch pack and 3 liters of water is usually sufficient.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beyond-hiking\">Beyond hiking</h2>\n<p>The city of the Zuberec is located nearby and offers both a supermarket and a few restaurants. Our top pick is the restaurant <strong>Koliba Josu</strong>. They have quite an abundance of different local dishes. Most of them with the common denominator of cabbage, meat and dumplings. The dishes are pretty filling and does a great job of replenishing your energy after a long day in the mountains. Aside from beer, I recommend the grape soda Vinea (red is the best!).</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"pancake.jpg\" title=\"A personal favorite - pancake with whipped cream and mountain blueberries\">\n</div>\n\n<p>Only 20 minutes drive from Zuberec you find the city of Oravice, which has a few hot thermal springs. The entrance fee is only 5 EUR and provides a nice relaxing setting. Give it a try!</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"thermal.jpg\" title=\"Ahhhhh, finally hitting the thermal pools\">\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"next-visit\">Next visit</h2>\n<p>For our last day we decided to visit the High Tatras, which is another part of the mountain range. This area is much larger and offers a great number of trails and peaks. The area was much more crowded and offered easier access for all kinds of tourists. However, as we started to gain altitude the majority of other hikers dropped off and we were left alone in the rocky landscape. I am really excited to get back to the Tatras and in particular to explore the High Tatras more.</p>\n<div class=\"media group\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"high-tatras.jpg\" title=\"Tranquility in High Tatras\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"top-of-high-tatras.jpg\" title=\"We made it to the top\">\n  <p class=\"media__caption\">The High Tatras took us by storm with its raw beauty</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>A big thank you to Klara, Andrei, Dennis, Karel, Niklas, Cem, Carlos, Patrik, Rebecca and Robin for making this an awesome experience.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"together.jpg\" title=\"A great joy of hiking is doing it together\">\n</div>\n"},{"title":"Serve private content from AWS S3","category":"Development","date":"November 1st, 2016","author":"Theodor Lindekaer","slug":"serve-private-content-from-aws-s3","description":"In this tutorial I will show you how to restrict access to the files you store in a AWS S3 bucket.

Next section is a brief overview of the technologies we are going to use.</p>\n<h2 id=\"s3-cloudfront-and-signed-urls\">S3, CloudFront and signed URLs</h2>\n<p><strong>S3</strong> is a storage solution from Amazon Web Services (AWS) for storing files. These files can be anything from <code>.html</code> (for hosting a static site) to various image and audio formats such as <code>.mp3</code> and <code>.mp4</code>. <strong>CloudFront</strong> is a CDN service that plays well together with other AWS services. Storing files and serving them over CDN is all well and good, but what if I want to enable only authenticated users to be able to download? Additionally, what if I want to restrict the access to, let&#39;s say, 20 seconds?</p>\n<p>An answer to this problem is <em>usage of signed URLs</em>. A signed URL is a URL that has been signed by a trusted authority. It is possible to include additional details in the signature such as time to expiry. This means that we can sign a URL pointing to a resource in our S3 bucket and ensure that only authenticated users can access it. There is a bit more nuance to the solution, but let&#39;s take a look at the implementation step for step.</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n  <img class=\"media__image\" data-src=\"overview.png\" title=\"Only clients with a signed URL are allowed to retrieve resources from the S3 bucket\">\n</div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"implementation\">Implementation</h2>\n<p>My implementation is mostly based on the AWS Console (web interface), but using the AWS CLI is also a possibility.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-create-s3-bucket\">1.

Install it in your project directory.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-shell\">npm install --save aws-cloudfront-sign\n</code></pre>\n<p>I will demonstrate the creation of a signed URL by implementing the <code>aws-cloudfront-sign</code> package in an Express route handler.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">import express from &#39;express&#39;\nimport cf from &#39;aws-cloudfront-sign&#39;\n\n// AWS specific options\nconst AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = &#39;xxxxxxxxxx&#39;\nconst AWS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH = &#39;./private-key.pem&#39;\nconst AWS_CLOUD_FRONT_URL = &#39;http://xxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net&#39;\n\n// Initialize the Express application\nconst app = express()\napp.listen(9000, () =&gt; console.log(&#39;Running on port 9000&#39;))\n\n// Setup route handler\napp.get(&#39;/images&#39;, createSignedUrl)\n\n// Signed URL logic\nfunction createSignedUrl (req, res) {\n  const name = req.query.name\n  const extension = req.query.ext\n  const options = {\n    keypairId: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,\n    privateKeyPath: AWS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH,\n    expireTime: new Date().getTime() + 45000\n  }\n  const url = `${AWS_CLOUD_FRONT_URL}/${name}.${extension}`\n  const signedUrl = cf.getSignedUrl(url, options)\n  res.json({ url: signedUrl })\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You will now be able to create a signed URL for the <code>funny_cat.jpg</code> in your <em>private</em> S3 bucket.

From the example, <code>Count</code> and <code>ScannedCount</code> are equal because no filtering is applied - everything that was scanned has been returned to us.\nPay particular attention to the <code>LastEvaluatedKey</code> property, as this is the required information to continue the pagination. If DynamoDB on a subsequent query is provided with <code>articleId</code>, <code>_id</code> and <code>timestamp</code>, it will be able to return the next batch of data in the correct order.</p>\n<p class=\"article__notice\">The <code>LastEvaluatedKey</code> property will only be returned from DynamoDB if <code>Count</code> is specified in the query or if the data exceeds 1 MB.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s take a look at our query for the next batch of data:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">const params = {\n  TableName: &#39;Comments&#39;,\n  Limit: ITEMS_PER_PAGE,\n  IndexName: &#39;articleId-timestamp-index&#39;,\n  KeyConditionExpression: &#39;articleId = :x&#39;,\n  ExpressionAttributeValues: {\n    &#39;:x&#39;: ARTICLE_ID\n  },\n  ExclusiveStartKey: { \n    articleId: 7,\n    _id: 114,\n    timestamp: 1478882696342 \n  } \n}\n\nconst result = await dynamo.query(params).promise()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that we have added the <code>ExclusiveStartKey</code> property and passed the result from <code>LastEvaluatedKey</code> as the value. Once executed, the query will return the next batch of data. In order to have the <code>LastEvaluatedKey</code> key available in our route handler for <code>/:articleId/comments</code>, you need to pass the value of <code>LastEvaluatedKey</code> to the client and then receive it again upon next request. </p>\n<p><em>A quick note</em> - you are able to change whether you receive the data in ascending or descending order by specifying the <code>ScanIndexForward</code> property when querying.</p>\n<p>Congratulations, you made it to the end! Pagination over and out 🔥</p>\n"},{"title":"About me","category":"Personal","date":"November 20th, 2016","author":"Theodor Lindekaer","slug":"about-me","description":"I'm a software engineering student currently writing my Master's thesis in WebRTC P2P Performance at the IT University of Copenhagen.

I am currently writing my Master&#39;s thesis on WebRTC at the IT University of Copenhagen and as an exercise to gather my thoughts here is an introduction to the concepts of WebRTC.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-it-\">What is it?</h2>\n<p> WebRTC is a collection of standards and protocols that enable two clients to establish a P2P connection. The connection can be used to stream video and audio or send arbitrary data without relying on plugins or other third-party software. The functionality is available through a high-level browser API that makes it really easy to get started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-api\">The API</h2>\n<p class=\"article__notice\">The WebRTC API is under development and the described interfaces may change over time. Check the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API\">Mozilla docs</a> for the newest version.</p>\n\n<p>WebRTC is available both in the browser (<a href=\"http://iswebrtcreadyyet.com/\">browser support table</a>) and in Node through the <code>wrtc</code> package. To avoid issues with browser prefixes for the different interfaces, you can use <code>adapter.js</code> which can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/webrtc/adapter\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>In order to get started with WebRTC, you have to know the following three interfaces:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, the linking of two peers</li>\n<li><code>RTCDataChannel</code>, the channel to transfer arbitrary binary data</li>\n<li><code>MediaStream</code>, the channel to transfer video and audio</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Everytime you to set up a P2P connection you need both sides to instantiate a <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>. Once instantiated you are able to create <code>DataChannel</code> and <code>MediaStream</code> directly from the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> instance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"core-concepts\">Core concepts</h2>\n<p>To dive deep into WebRTC you have to familiarize yourself with a quite a few concepts and technologies. However, to get started you just need a basic understanding of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Session Description Protocol (SDP)</li>\n<li>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)</li>\n<li>Signaling</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>SDP</strong>: Whenever two peers want to establish a connection, they need to agree on a contract (or <em>rules</em>) for the connection. SDP is a way to describe the details of such a contract. In the context of WebRTC one peer sends an <strong>SDP offer</strong> to the other peer, who consumes the offer and generates a corresponding <strong>SDP answer</strong>. In essence, SDP is just a document format that describes connection parameters. </p>\n<p><strong>ICE</strong>: Two peers who would like to establish a connection will have to exhange addresses and ports, so they are able to reach each other. Usually a peer is located behind a NAT, firewall or other barriers, which means that it doesn&#39;t expose a direct public IP address. The process of ICE makes it possible to <em>traverse the NAT</em>. The protocols used for this are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN\">STUN</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT\">TURN</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Signaling</strong>: The above mentioned process of finding each other is accomplished through signaling. A signaling server is an intermediary between two peers and facilitates the initial connection by exchanging offer/answer. Once the connection is etablished, the peers communicate purely on a direct P2P connection with no need for a server. A common approach to signaling is a simple Websocket server.</p>\n<p>To really dig into the details I can recommend the documents from IETF:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc3264\">SDP RFC</a> by IEFF</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc5245\">ICE RFC</a> by IETF</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"data-channel-example\">Data channel example</h2>\n<p>In order for two peers (<strong>Peer1</strong> and <strong>Peer2</strong>) to setup a data channel the following sequence of actions will have to take place:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Peer1 instantiates a <code>RTCPeerConnection</code></li>\n<li>Peer1 creates a <code>DataChannel</code></li>\n<li>Peer1 creates a SDP offer</li>\n<li>Peer1 gathers ICE candidates</li>\n<li>Peer1 sends offer to Peer2</li>\n<li>Peer2 instantiates a <code>RTCPeerConnection</code></li>\n<li>Peer2 generates a SDP answer based on Peer1&#39;s offer</li>\n<li>Peer2 gathers ICE candidates</li>\n<li>Peer2 sends answer to Peer1</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let&#39;s dive into the code - is will not be as much as it looks from the list above ⚡️</p>\n<p>Firstly, the initial setup for <strong>Peer1</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">import { RTCPeerConnection } from &#39;wrtc&#39;\n\n// Setup of P2P connection and data channel\nconst pc1 = new RTCPeerConnection()\nconst dc = pc1.createDataChannel()\n\n// Add event handlers on data channel\ndc.onopen = () =&gt; console.log(&#39;Peer 1: Data channel has opened&#39;)\ndc.onmessage = (event) =&gt; console.log(`Peer 1: Got message: &quot;${event.data}&quot;`)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we need to create an offer that we can send to <strong>Peer2</strong>. Once the offer is created, we set the offer as the local description of the peer connection.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">// A set of options for a data offer (no audio or video)\nconst options = {\n  offerToReceiveAudio: false,\n  offerToReceiveVideo: false\n}\n\n// Create an offer with the specified options\npc1.createOffer((offer) =&gt; {\n  // Set the offer as the local description\n  pc1.setLocalDescription(offer, () =&gt; {\n    console.log(&#39;Peer 1: Setting local description&#39;)\n  }, errorHandler)\n}, errorHandler, options)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Even though the offer is created, we still need to gather all the possible ICE candidates befores sending the offer off to <strong>Peer2</strong>. When you call <code>setLocalDescription</code> the process of finding potential ICE candidates begins. For each candidate, the <code>onicecandidate</code> event fires on the <code>PeerConnection</code>. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">// Event handler for candidates\npc1.onicecandidate = (event) =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;Peer 1: Found an ICE candidate&#39;)\n  // This fires when no more candidates are to be found\n  if (event.candidate === null) {\n    // Send offer to Peer2\n    sendOffer(pc1.localDescription)\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>A few things to note here. Once all the candidates have been gathered, we can access the final offer through <code>pc1.localDescription</code>. The function <code>sendOffer</code> can be any function that sends the offer to <strong>Peer2</strong>. This is trivial in our case, since both <strong>Peer1</strong> and <strong>Peer2</strong> are in the same <code>.js</code> file.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">// Setup of P2P connection\nconst pc2 = new RTCPeerConnection()\n\nfunction sendOffer (offer) {\n  // Set the offer from Peer1 as remote description\n  console.log(&#39;Peer 2: Setting remote description&#39;)\n  pc2.setRemoteDescription(offer)\n  // Create an answer\n  pc2.createAnswer((answer) =&gt; {\n    // Set the answer as the local description\n    pc2.setLocalDescription(answer, () =&gt; {\n      console.log(&#39;Peer 2: Setting local description&#39;)\n    }, errorHandler)\n  }, errorHandler)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As we just saw with <strong>Peer1</strong>, we need to gather the potential ICE candidates before we can send back the answer.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">pc2.onicecandidate = (event) =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;Peer 2: Found an ICE candidate&#39;)\n  // This fires when no more candidates are to be found\n  if (event.candidate === null) {\n    // Send offer to Peer1\n    sendAnswer(pc2.localDescription)\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now the very last step required to set up the P2P connection:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">function sendAnswer (answer) {\n  // Peer1 sets the answer as the remote description\n  console.log(&#39;Peer 1: Setting remote description&#39;)\n  pc1.setRemoteDescription(answer)\n  // ... and the connection is established!\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can test out the connection by sending a message from <strong>Peer2</strong> to <strong>Peer1</strong>. We just need to attach and event handler that listens for the opening of the data channel.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">pc2.ondatachannel = (event) =&gt; {\n  console.log(&#39;Peer 2: Sending message&#39;)\n  event.channel.send(&#39;Cookies 4 life&#39;)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Run the code and check the console output: </p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">Peer 1: Setting local description\nPeer 1: Found an ICE candidate\nPeer 1: Found an ICE candidate\nPeer 1: Found an ICE candidate\nPeer 1: Found an ICE candidate\n# Offer sent to Peer2\nPeer 2: Setting remote description\nPeer 2: Setting local description\nPeer 2: Found an ICE candidate\nPeer 2: Found an ICE candidate\nPeer 2: Found an ICE candidate\n# Answer sent to Peer1\nPeer 1: Setting remote description\nPeer 1: Data channel has opened\nPeer 2: Sending message\nPeer 1: Got message: &quot;Cookies 4 life&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>As soon as both sides of the connection have set both the local and remote description, we have a P2P connection between the two peers. Through the <code>DataChannel</code> they are able to send data (even files!) to each other.\nYou are not restricted to having only one data channel between a set of peers - theoretically you can have <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCDataChannel\">65,534</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next-\">What&#39;s next?</h2>\n<p>I hope this simple walkthrough has sparked an interest in you.
