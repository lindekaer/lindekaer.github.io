In this tutorial I will walk you through using pagination with DynamoDB. We are going to use a simple dataset of comments to articles on a website.

Here is a small snapshot of the dataset:

```javascript
// ...
{ _id: '112', timestamp: 1478882596941, articleId: '7', author: 'Xia Long', text: '...' },
{ _id: '113', timestamp: 1478882597111, articleId: '7', author: 'Ben Langdon', text: '...' },
{ _id: '114', timestamp: 1478882696342, articleId: '7', author: 'John Doe', text: '...' },
{ _id: '115', timestamp: 1478892592919, articleId: '6', author: 'Mike Dott', text: '...' }
// ...
```

Each article has the following properties:

- `_id`, a unique ID for the comment
- `timestamp`, the timestamp when the comment was made
- `articleId`, the ID for the article commented on
- `author`, name of the comment author
- `text`, the comment text

## Pagination
When you paginate through data, you consume it bit by bit. It's easy to understand with the analogy to a book. For each page your turn, you see the next batch of 500 words. Simple pagination simply uses the primary key (`_id` in our case) and gradually goes through all of the data. But what if you want to iterate only a subset in a specific order?

For our dataset, we would like to paginate only those comments belonging to a specific article and order the results by `timestamp`. Hopefully the walkthrough will help you to achieve your own 'beyond-basic' pagination goals.

## DynamoDB setup
With this in mind, let's proceed to the AWS console (web UI) to setup our DynamoDB.

- Go to `DynamoDB` from the AWS console
- Click **Create Table**
- As **Table Name** write *Comments*
- As **Primary Key** write *_id* and set it as string
- Click **Create**

Now AWS is setting up your DynamoDB - please be patient! üçâüåÆüçá
When your table is ready, we can proceed.

- Click **Tables** in the left navigation
- Click the **Comments** table
- Click **Indexes** in the top navigation
- Click **Create Index**

Now things get exciting! Because we want to be able to query on `articleId` (which is *not* the primary key) and fetch the results in order of `timestamp`, we need to do the following:

- Write *articleId* as **Primary Key**
- Check **Add sort key** and write *timestamp*
- Ensure that *timestamp* is set as number (DynamoDB needs to know how to sort the rows)
- Click **Create Index**

Now fill in some records before proceeding.

## Querying DynamoDB
Now we are set up and ready to start querying our DynamoDB. I will be using the AWS SDK for JS, but you can pick your own flavour.
Start by initializing the AWS SDK:

```javascript
import AWS from 'aws-sdk'

AWS.config.update({
  accessKeyId: 'YOUR_KEY_ID',
  secretAccessKey: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
  region: 'eu-central-1' // region of choice
})

const dynamo = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient() 
```

Image we have an Express (NodeJS server framework) application running exposing the `/:articleId/comments` endpoint

```javascript
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
app.listen(9000)

app.get('/:articleId/comments', fetchComments)
```

When clients fetch our comments from the endpoint they specify

- `articleId` directly in the route
- `items` in the query string

like this:

```shell
curl /7/comments?items=10
```

We are then able to construct our query for DynamoDB 

```javascript
const ITEMS_PER_PAGE = req.query.items
const ARTICLE_ID = req.params.articleId

const params = {
  TableName: 'Comments',
  Limit: ITEMS_PER_PAGE,
  IndexName: 'articleId-timestamp-index',
  KeyConditionExpression: 'articleId = :x',
  ExpressionAttributeValues: {
    ':x': ARTICLE_ID
  }
}

const result = await dynamo.query(params).promise()
```

The result from the query above looks something like this:

```javascript
{ 
  Items: [
    { _id: '112', timestamp: 1478882596941, articleId: '7', author: 'Xia Long', text: '...' },
    { _id: '113', timestamp: 1478882597111, articleId: '7', author: 'Ben Langdon', text: '...' },
    { _id: '114', timestamp: 1478882696342, articleId: '7', author: 'John Doe', text: '...' } 
  ],
  Count: 3,
  ScannedCount: 3,
  LastEvaluatedKey: { 
    articleId: 7,
    _id: 114,
    timestamp: 1478882696342 
  } 
}
```

The `Items` property holds the retrieved data, while the other keys provide information about the query. From the example, `Count` and `ScannedCount` are equal because no filtering is applied - everything that was scanned has been returned to us.
Pay particular attention to the `LastEvaluatedKey` property, as this is the required information to continue the pagination. If DynamoDB on a subsequent query is provided with `articleId`, `_id` and `timestamp`, it will be able to return the next batch of data in the correct order.

<p class="article__notice">The `LastEvaluatedKey` property will only be returned from DynamoDB if `Count` is specified in the query or if the data exceeds 1 MB.</p>

Let's take a look at our query for the next batch of data:

```javascript
const params = {
  TableName: 'Comments',
  Limit: ITEMS_PER_PAGE,
  IndexName: 'articleId-timestamp-index',
  KeyConditionExpression: 'articleId = :x',
  ExpressionAttributeValues: {
    ':x': ARTICLE_ID
  },
  ExclusiveStartKey: { 
    articleId: 7,
    _id: 114,
    timestamp: 1478882696342 
  } 
}

const result = await dynamo.query(params).promise()
```

Notice that we have added the `ExclusiveStartKey` property and passed the result from `LastEvaluatedKey` as the value. Once executed, the query will return the next batch of data. In order to have the `LastEvaluatedKey` key available in our route handler for `/:articleId/comments`, you need to pass the value of `LastEvaluatedKey` to the client and then receive it again upon next request. 

*A quick note* - you are able to change whether you receive the data in ascending or descending order by specifying the `ScanIndexForward` property when querying.

Congratulations, you made it to the end! Pagination over and out üî•
