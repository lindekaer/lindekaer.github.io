Last weekend I went for a hike with a group of friends to explore the park. We spent approximately two full days in late March.</p><div id="map1" data-lat="56.026805" data-lng="13.234562" data-zoom="12" data-type="outdoors"></div><h2 id="hiking">Hiking</h2><p>The park offers a range of marked hiking trails. The shortest trail being 800 meters and the longest <span class="distance">14 kilometers</span>. Since nature is allowed to grow wildly, some of the trail markings can be hard to spot, so pay attention when walking. The hiking terrain is fairly flat and welcomes even the most unexperienced hikers.</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" src="/img/hiking-in-soderasen.cliffs.jpg" title="Hiking the steep cliffs around Odensjön"><p class="media__caption">Hiking the steep cliffs around Odensjön</p></div><p>The <span class="distance">1000 kilometer</span> long Skåneleden hike goes straight through the park from Klåveröd in the north-western corner to Röstånga in the south-eastern corner. We found this hike to be very rewarding and the path took is past the main sights: the wonderful <strong>Odensjön lake</strong>, the <strong>Hjortsprånget viewpoint</strong> and the <strong>Kopparhatten</strong> cliffs. Going for the hike is a perfect excuse to grab a lunch at <strong>Röstånga Gästgivaregård</strong>, which serves traditional Swedish meals at a fair price. We had the lunch buffet for <span class="currency">SEK 150</span>.</p><h2 id="lodging">Lodging</h2><p>Söderåsen offers different possibilities for lodging. There are two cabins located centrally in the park - <strong>Liagården</strong> and <strong>Dahlbergs</strong>. We decided to sleep in <strong>Liagården</strong> and were able to park the car nearby. The cabin has four simple rooms that provides shelter from wind and weather - there is no running water or electricity. Outside the cabin one may use a water pump to get fresh water. Additionaly there are toilets as well as a shed providing free firewood. You are also able to bring your own tent and camp on the cabin grounds.</p><div class="media"><img class="media__image" src="/img/hiking-in-soderasen.cabin.jpg" title="Enjoying the sun outside Dahlbergs cabin"><p class="media__caption">Enjoying the sun outside Dahlbergs cabin</p></div><h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2><p>Going to Söderåsen is a great plan for a weekend getaway. Using the park and its facilities is free. For hikers the park does not offer enough variation, but does on the other hand work perfectly for trying out camping gear and enjoying zen-like moments in the wild.</p></div></div><div class="navigation__back"><a href="/">Go back</a></div></div><script src="assets/js/dist-vendor.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/dist.min.js"></script></body></html>
