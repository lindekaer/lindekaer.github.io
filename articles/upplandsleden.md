Living in Scandinavia, you are surrounded by amazing hiking opportunities. My friend Ole and I decided to check out **Upplandsleden** located in the Uppland province of Sweden (the same as where Stockholm is located). We hiked three full days in the middle of April.

## Our hike

We estimated that it would be possible to walk around 30 kilometers per day. Upon arriving to Uppsala, we went by bus to the small city Gimo. From Gimo we joined Upplandsleden and started walking southbound. This plan left us with approximately 40 kilometers per day and thus a little wiggle room if our legs could carry us further.

We brought a complete sleeping system with mat, sleeping bag and tent. We ended up using the tent for the two first days and slept in a shelter at **Rastplats Kolsjön** for the last night. The shelter was amazing - located next to a lake, with a practical fireplace and with dry firewood. Due to the many shelter on Upplandsleden it is possible to plan a trip sleeping only in shelters.
